    An optional feature on all Air Tractors is the cockpit heater. Hot air is taken from the compressor section of the
    engine and routed to a valve forward of the cockpit. The valve is opened by pulling up on the knob on the left side
    of the seat above the floor (AT-502A/502B) or the center-mounted floor console (AT- 504). The amount of heat can be
    regulated by the amount of valve opening. Hot air is piped to the diffuser on the forward side of the cockpit on the
    floor.

    The bleed air tap on the engine has a restrictor fitting to limit the amount of hot air that is available, and this
    restrictor should never be removed from the connection.
