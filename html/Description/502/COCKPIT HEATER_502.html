    The heater system taps bleed air off the engine compressor section and routes it to an ON-OFF valve on the left-hand side of the fuselage just forward of the cockpit. This valve may be actuated by pulling up on a cable marked HEAT located on the left side of the seat above the floor (AT-502A/AT-502B) or the center-mounted floor console (AT-504). The volume of heat can be regulated by the amount of valve opening. Hot air is piped to the diffuser on the forward side of the cockpit on the
    floor.

The bleed air tap on the engine has a restrictor fitting to limit the amount of hot air that is available, and this
restrictor should never be removed from the connection.

To limit power loss in the case of line failure to the valve, the bleed valve outlet fitting that attaches to the compressor case has a "choke" welded to the mounting plate. The “choke" limits the diameter of the compressor tap to <span style="color: red;">.250 inches. -- (is this the correct dimension?)</span>
