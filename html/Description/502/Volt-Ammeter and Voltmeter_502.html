<p>Voltammeter - The AT-502 or AT-504 with the 250-amp electrical system is equipped with a voltammeter. This dual-scale gauge normally reads generator output amperage. Voltage may be read by pressing the button on the bezel of the instrument.

This conventional meter reads system voltage from the airplane's electrical bus.

The ammeter function of the voltammeter receives its signal from the precision 50-milli-Ohm shunt in the generator output circuit. The ammeter measures the voltage drop across the shunt. This voltage drop is proportional to the current flowing through the shunt, so the meter displays the current units (amps) that correspond to the drop in voltage.
