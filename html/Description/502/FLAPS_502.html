Extra-large Fowler-type flaps are incorporated on the Air Tractor. The flaps are electrically operated and may be stopped at any position from 0° to the maximum of 26° of travel. The flaps are controlled by a switch conveniently mounted just below the throttle quadrant. The flaps have external markings which may be viewed from the cockpit with each mark being 10° of travel.

The flaps are very effective for both take-off and landing. For a short take-off roll, 10° of flaps are normally used. The flaps are also useful during turns, although generally less than 10° is used. <span style="color: red;">Should this paragraph reference the max allowed flaps for turns (from the AFM) instead of specifiying 10 degrees?</span>
