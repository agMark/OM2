    Extra-large Fowler-type flaps are incorporated on the Air Tractor. The flaps are electrically operated and may be
    stopped at any position from 0˚ to the maximum of 26˚ travel. The flaps are controlled by a switch conveniently
    mounted just below the throttle quadrant. The flaps have external markings which may be viewed from the cockpit with
    each of the first two marks being 10˚ of travel.

    The flaps are very effective for both take-off and landing. For a short take-off roll, 10˚ of flap is normally used.
    The flaps are also useful during turns, although no more than 10˚ should be used.
