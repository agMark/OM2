<p>Elevator and trim are the primary and secondary controls for changing pitch in flight. The elevator is controlled from the stick, moving push-pull tubes to articulate the horizontal stabilizer. Moving the stick forwards and backwards will pitch the nose of the airplane down and up respectively. <span style="color: red;">Unlike roll and yaw controls, elevators are not spring loaded. (is this correct?)</span>

Pitch trim is used to adjust steady level stick forces at specific airspeed, altitude and power settings. Elevator trim is operated by wheels on the left hand side of the pilot. Through a series of control cables, the wheel sets the trim tab to hold each control surface.
