    The ailerons are of all-metal construction and hinged on ball bearings. The bellcranks and pushrod ends operate on
    ball bearings, producing smooth operation and low system friction. The stick forces are light, and the ailerons are
    very responsive. The light stick forces are a result of the installation of aerodynamic servo tabs installed on the
    outboard end of each aileron.

    The ailerons are interconnected with the wing flaps so that as the flaps move down through 26˚, the ailerons droop
    10˚. The interconnection is non-linear so that most of the aileron droop occurs with the first half of the flap
    travel. This provides optimum conditions for short take-off performance.

    Each aileron has a large balance weight on the outboard end of the aileron just forward of the leading edge. These
    weights must never be removed as they are necessary for flutter prevention.

<p class="boldText">Bendable Aileron Trim Tabs</p>

<p>
    Small bendable aileron trim tabs are installed on the trailing edge of each aileron. These tabs allow the pilot to
    make minor adjustments to the airplane's roll trim by adding a small amount of up or down force to the trailing edge
    of the aileron in flight.
</p>

<p>
    To make an aileron trim adjustment, fly the airplane at normal cruise power and normal cruise speed in smooth air.
    While flying the airplane in coordinated flight (ball centered), evaluate the airplane's natural rolling tendency
    with the controls free, and evaluate the amount of stick force required to fly the airplane wings level. In the case
    of “left wing heavy”, the pilot should bend the left bendable tab trailing edge UP, and the right tab trailing edge
    DOWN. Use a hand seamer or other similar tool to make a clean, even bend. Avoid excessive bend angle, because the
    bendable tabs will stall and become ineffective at bend angles greater than 20 degrees. Make tab adjustments in
    small increments and re-fly the airplane to re-evaluate roll trim.
