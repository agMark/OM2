The ailerons are of all-metal construction and hinged on ball bearings. The bellcranks and pushrod ends operate on ball bearings, producing smooth operation and low system friction. The stick forces are light, and the ailerons are very responsive. The light stick forces are a result of the installation of aerodynamic servo tabs installed on the outboard end of each aileron.

The ailerons are interconnected with the wing flaps so that as the flaps travel to full deflection of 26o down, the ailerons also droop approximately 10o. The interconnection is non-linear so that most of the aileron droop occurs during the first half of downward flap travel. This helps to provide the optimum condition for short take-off performance.

Each aileron has a large balance weight on the outboard end of the aileron just forward of the leading edge. These weights must never be removed as they are necessary for the prevention of aerodynamic flutter.
