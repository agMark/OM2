<p>The aileron-rudder interconnect system assists with turn coordination when the rudder or ailerons are used.
</p>
A stainless-steel cable attached to the rudder pedals is routed through a pulley aft of the cockpit to the inboard interconnect idler arm. A cable with springs attached to each end is routed from the outboard interconnect idler arm, through multiple pulleys, to the forward horn of the upper aileron torque tube.
</p>
The aileron-rudder interconnect idler is designed so that small aileron or rudder deflections may be made without engagement of the interconnect system. When significant aileron deflection is applied, the interconnect system will apply a force to the rudder controls to assist with turn coordination. Similarly, when ample rudder deflection is applied, the interconnect system will apply a force to the aileron controls to assist with turn coordination. This system allows banking the airplane with rudder application alone. <span style="color: red;">(is there a aileron-rudder interconnect on 502s/504s?
