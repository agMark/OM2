Engine air is drawn in through the inlet scoop, through a barrier type filter and into a sealed plenum which is located between the forward and aft engine firewalls. There are three different filter installations that Air Tractor has used on AT-502A/502B/504 aircraft. Each of these filter installations is over 99% efficient and causes only a negligible pressure drop due to the ram air pressure developed by the air scoop.

The earliest air filter system used two large, cylindrical commercial truck filters. These filters are Donaldson p/n P182043 (alternate is P510337) for the AT-502B/504 and Donaldson p/n P181008 (alternate is P510335) for the AT-502A. Aircraft equipped with the Air Tractor Ram Air system have the air scoop moved from the lower side of the engine cowling to the nose of the aircraft, just below the propeller. This ram air configuration may have one of two different filter systems. The first system uses a pleated filter element made by Donaldson (p/n P613731 for the AT-502B/504, p/n 52427-17 for the AT-502A (w/ -45R, -60AG, and -65AG engines)) pleated filter element. This filter looks like a paper element filter but is actually synthetic. The second type of ram air filter is a Brackett foam air filter. This filter is a disposable foam element filter that contains a sticky residue “wettant” that traps and holds dirt and debris.	This is a lightweight, flexible filter installed in a stainless steel frame inside of the engine plenum. The part number for the Brackett foam filter is BA-409E for the AT-502B/504 and BA-413E for the AT-502A (w/ -45R, -60AG and -65AG engines).

A pressure differential switch is installed on the top R/H side of the aft firewall with one probe in the engine area and the other probe located in the plenum. At the point where the pressure difference between the air in the engine area and the air in the plenum reaches the set point, the air filter light on the instrument panel illuminates. The set point is 13.0 inches of water vacuum for AT-502B/504 aircraft and AT-502A aircraft with the PT6A-140AG engine.  The set point is 15.0 inches of water vacuum for AT-502A aircraft equipped with the PT6A-45R/-60AG/-65AG engines. This light has a “push-to-test” feature and should be checked before the engine is started.
