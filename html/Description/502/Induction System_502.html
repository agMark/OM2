    Engine air is drawn in through the inlet scoop, through a barrier type filter and into a sealed plenum which is
    located between the forward and aft engine firewalls. There are three different filter installations that Air
    Tractor has used on AT-502A/502B/504 aircraft. Each of these filter installations is over 99% efficient and cause
    only a negligible pressure drop due to the ram air pressure developed by the air scoop.

    The earliest air filter system used two large, cylindrical commercial truck filters. These filters are Donaldson p/n
    P182043 (alternate is P510337) for the AT-502B/504 and Donaldson p/n P181008 (alternate is P510335) for the AT-502A.
    Aircraft equipped with the Air Tractor Ram Air system have the airscoop moved from the lower side of the engine
    cowling to the nose of the aircraft, just below the propeller. This Ram Air configuration may have one of two
    different filter systems. The first system uses a pleated filter element made by Donaldson (p/n P613731 for the
    AT-502B/504, p/n 52427-17 for the AT-502A (w/ -45R, -60AG, and -65AG engines)) pleated filter element. This filter
    looks like a paper element filter but is actually synthetic.

    The second type of Ram Air filter is a Brackett foam air filter. This filter is a disposable foam element filter
    that contains a sticky residue “wettant” that traps and holds dirt and debris. This is a lightweight, flexible
    filter that is installed in a stainless-steel frame inside the engine plenum. The part number for the Brackett foam
    filter is BA-409E for the AT-502B/504 and BA-413E for the AT-502A (w/ -45R, -60AG, and -65AG engines).

    A pressure differential switch is installed on the top R/H side of the aft firewall with one probe in the engine
    area and the other probe in the plenum. At such time that the pressure difference between the air in the engine area
    and the air in the plenum reaches the set point, the air filter light on the instrument panel will come on. The set
    point is 13 inches of water vacuum for AT-502B/504 aircraft and AT-502A aircraft with the PT6A-140AG engine. The set
    point is 15 inches of water vacuum for AT-502A aircraft with the PT6A-45R/-60AG, -65AG engines. This light has a
    “push to test” feature and should be checked before the engine is started.
