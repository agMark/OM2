The horizontal stabilizers are all-metal and strut-supported for rigidity. The struts are constructed of streamlined 4130N tubing. The struts have a stainless-steel clevis where the attachment to the stabilizer is made. The clevis is adjustable in order to rig the stabilizers properly with the wing and in a straight line from side to side.

The vertical fin is cantilever and is of all-metal construction. A wire deflector cable, attached to the top of the vertical fin, extends to an anchor point at the top of the canopy.

The control surface hinge bearings have a single stainless-steel ball with a Teflon lining. Long bearing life without lubrication can be expected.

The elevator trim tabs act as servo tabs in addition to providing longitudinal trim for the Air Tractor. Because of the large tab size, the trim tabs provide a considerable amount of trim authority. Removable bronze bushings are provided at each joint. As these bushings wear, they should be replaced so that trim tab free play may be kept to a minimum. The all-metal rudder has a servo tab which also serves as an adjustable trim tab.
