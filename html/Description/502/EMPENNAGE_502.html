    The horizontal stabilizers are all-metal and strut-supported for rigidity. The struts are constructed of streamlined
    4130N tubing. The struts have a stainless clevis where the attachment to the stabilizer is made, and the clevis is
    adjustable in order to rig the stabilizers properly with the wing and in a straight line from side to side.

    The vertical fin is cantilever and is of all-metal construction. It has a relatively short span in order to minimize
    the hazards of working under telephone lines or other obstructions. A heavy-duty wire deflector cable is attached to
    the top of the vertical fin and extends to the top of the canopy where it is anchored.

    The control surface hinges have a single stainless-steel ball with a Teflon lining. Long bearing life can be
    expected, and it is not necessary to lubricate the hinge.

    The elevator trim tabs act as Servo tabs in addition to providing longitudinal trim for the Air Tractor. Because of
    the large tab size, the trim tabs provide a considerable amount of trim authority. Removable bronze bushings are
    provided at each joint. As the bushing wear, they should be replaced so that trim tab free play may be kept to a
    minimum. The all-metal rudder has a servo tab that also serves as an adjustable trim tab.
