The Pratt & Whitney PT6A series of engines have been proven to be one of the most reliable power plants available today. The engine is a lightweight, reverse flow, free turbine engine utilizing two independent turbine sections. One section drives the compressor in the gas generator section and the second drives the propeller shaft through a gear reduction box.
<p>
Air enters the engine through an annular plenum chamber, passing through a three- or four-stage axial and a single-stage centrifugal compressor. In the combustion chamber, fuel mixed with air is ignited. The expanding gasses are directed through the three turbines and out the exhaust ports on opposing sides of the engine.

The standard engine for the AT-502B/504 is a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-34AG turboprop engine. This engine is rated at 750 HP for take-off at sea level and 87o F. Maximum take-off torque is 1790 ft-lbs., maximum ITT is 725o C., maximum Ng is 101.5% and maximum Np for all operations is 2200 RPM.
<p>
The AT-502B may also be equipped with a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-15AG turboprop engine. This engine is rated at 680 SHP and 1628 ft-lbs of torque for takeoff. Maximum ITT for takeoff is 725 °C., maximum Ng is 101.5% and maximum Np for all operations is 2200 RPM.
<p>
The standard engine for the AT-502A is the PT6A-60AG. This engine is rated at 1050 SHP with a maximum torque for take-off is 3245 ft-lb. and ITT maximum of 820o C. For airplanes with the PT6A-65AG, the engine is rated at 1100 SHP and 3398 ft-lbs of torque on takeoff with a maximum ITT of 820 °C. For airplanes with the PT6A-45R, the engine is rated at 1100 SHP and 3398 ft-lbs of torque on takeoff with a maximum ITT of 800 °C. The maximum Ng for all of these engines is 104.0% and the maximum Np for all operations is 1700 RPM.
<p>
AT-502A aircraft with the PT6A-140AG engine have a maximum of 867 SHP and 2397 ft-lbs of torque on takeoff with a maximum ITT of 870° C. The maximum Ng is 103.7% and the maximum Np for all operations is 1900 RPM.
<p>
For long engine life it is recommended that the ITT be kept well below the maximum limits. Use only enough power on take-off to operate safely from the strip being used.
