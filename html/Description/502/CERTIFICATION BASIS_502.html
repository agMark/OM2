The AT-502A/502B/504 aircraft series is structurally certified to meet the requirements of FAR 23. The engine installation, systems and equipment meet FAR 23 requirements (except in cases where inappropriate for agricultural operations). In such cases, placards are installed on the instrument panel which prohibits flying under those special conditions. The AT-502A/502B/504 series is certificated by the manufacturer for a gross takeoff weight of 8,000 pounds. However, under the provisions of CAR Part 8, the operator may select his own maximum operating weight. Field experience confirms that higher operating weights may be carried safely with adequate margins of performance and structural strength. See the aircraft Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) and Service Letter #304 for more information.

Certification basis is FAR 21.25 (a) (1), including certain paragraphs of FAR 23 applicable to turbine engine installations.
