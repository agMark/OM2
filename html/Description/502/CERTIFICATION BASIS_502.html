    The AT-502A/502B/504 is structurally certified to meet the requirements of FAR 23. The engine 
    installation along with the systems and equipment meet FAR 23 requirements except in cases where 
    inappropriate for agricultural operations. In these cases placards are installed on the instrument panel which 
    prohibit flying under those special conditions. The AT-502A/502B/504 is certificated by the manufacturer for 
    a gross weight of 8,000 pounds. However, under the provisions of Part 8 the operator may select his own 
    maximum operating weight, and field experience shows that higher operating weights be carried safely with 
    adequate margins of performance and structural strength. See aircraft Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) 
    and Service Letter #304 for more information.
