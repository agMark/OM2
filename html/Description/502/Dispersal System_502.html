The layout of the Ag dispersal system is shown in Figure 1-7 below. The standard spray system includes two-inch stainless plumbing and streamlined extruded aluminum booms. Thirty-eight nozzles are incorporated although the boom is drilled and tapped for an additional 36 nozzles if desired. Quick couplers are used in order to remove the booms and pump from the aircraft in minutes. The spray pump is an Agrinautics two-inch capacity pump. The fan is a Micronair five-blade adjustable pitch fan. The control valve is manufacturer by Transland and the strainer is by Air Tractor. The bottom-load valve is made by Transland and is two-and-a-half-inches in diameter. </p><span style="color: red;">(several part numbers were removed from the original 502OM)</span>

All hoses used in the spray system have a special lining which is impervious to nearly all chemicals. The hoses are double clamped at all connections with stainless worm-drive clamps. All plumbing parts have beaded ends to provide secure hose attachments.

Spray nozzles installed at the factory are for medium volume applications. For high volume spraying, larger spray tips should be installed. If this does not provide the required flow rates, the pump may be changed to a Transland 4-inch pump. With this pump and with 96 nozzles with larger spray tips installed, flow rates on the order of 300 gallons per minute are possible at pressures of approximately 30 psi. See Report 1117. <span style="color: red;">(are these the correct values for  502s/504s? This paragraph is copied from 802OM and part numbers removed)</span>

The boom pressure gauge is part of the dispersal monitoring system. Nylon tubing is used to connect the boom pressure gauge to the boom through the lower fuselage skin.

The fan brake lever is an industrial over-center type lever which has considerable leverage stop the optional Micronair fan instantly. The brake cable tension can be adjusted in the cockpit by rotating the brake lever handle. The Weath-Aero fan does not require a brake.
</p>
Micronair rotary atomizers may be installed if desired. The factory supplies a special boom for 8 atomizers.<span style="color: red;">(Would suggest this paragraph be deleted. Copied from 802OM)</span>

For dry materials, a <span style="color: red;">Transland? </span> extra-high-volume spreader is used. For rapid changeover from spray to dry materials, remove only the pump and booms. The gate box adapter is fitted with a flapper valve to prevent fertilizer from getting into the bottom load tube. For extended fertilizer application it is suggested that the center boom assembly and control valve be removed to prevent fertilizer from getting into the valve assembly. This can be accomplished in only a few minutes by removing the stainless T-pins that support the center boom assembly and removing the bolts that attach the valve to the stainless bracket.

The Air Tractor features a near-leak-proof hopper lid that allows full liquid loads to be carried. The leak-proof feature is made possible by a sturdy over-center latch assembly and a curved hopper top that allows the hopper lid to be pulled solidly into place. Stainless-steel over-center clamps positioned on the fore-and-aft edges of the hopper lid assist in providing the near leak-proof feature. Medium-density nitrile 3/8" x 1" - wide strip is used for the hopper lid gasket.
</p>
The hopper vent tube is welded <span style="color: red;">3"</span> diameter stainless-steel tubing inside the hopper. A <span style="color: red;">3"</span> diameter stainless ball is used to seal the overboard vent when the liquid level reaches the top of the hopper. The vent tube protruding from the adapter box sides is made of aluminum. They can be rotated to point forward to provide positive pressure in the hopper for dry material application. This slight pressurization in the hopper requires a little less gate opening for a given poundage which reduces the blockage effects of the door opening into the slipstream. When the vent tube is rotated to point aft, a slight negative pressure is created inside the hopper which prevents any fumes from escaping around the hopper lid gasket.

An optional spreader is the Transland 54401 NorCal Swathmaster, requiring the p/n 24274 adapter box and 25-inch gate box. <span style="color: red;">(are these the correct values for  502s/504s? This paragraph is copied from 802OM and part numbers removed)</span>
