    The standard spray system includes two-inch stainless plumbing and streamlined extruded aluminum booms. Thirty-eight
    nozzles are incorporated although the boom is drilled and tapped for an additional 36 nozzles if desired. Quick
    couplers are used in order to remove the booms and pump from the aircraft in minutes. The spray pump is an
    Agrinautics p/n 65219 two-inch capacity pump. The fan is a Micronair five blade adjustable pitch fan. The control
    valve is a Transland p/n 20384 and the strainer is an Air Tractor p/n 80392-12. The bottom-load valve is a Transland
    two and a half inch p/n 22395.

    All hoses used in the spray system have a special lining which is impervious to nearly all chemicals. The hoses are
    double clamped at all connections with stainless worm-drive clamps. All plumbing parts have beaded ends to provide
    secure hose attachments.
</p>

<p>
    However, high line pressures and water-hammer effects can blow fittings loose and it is a good practice to wire all
    Quick-couplers together with a loop or two of safety wire. In addition, stainless steel straps are used to safety
    the plumbing on the discharge side of the pump to the top of the pump, and at the spray valve.
</p>

<p>
    Spray nozzles used are Spraying Systems Inc. p/n 4666 diaphragm check valve, p/n 1/8 Q JJ-V body, p/n QU-4010 Spray
    tip. The aircraft is equipped with -4010 spray tips which are for medium volume applications.

    The boom pressure gauge is glycerin-filled for long gauge life and to prevent needle fluctuations. Copper tubing is
    used to connect the boom pressure gauge to a bulkhead fitting in the lower fuselage skin. From the bulkhead fitting
    to the center boom assembly a Stratoflex hose is used.

<p>
    The fan brake lever is an industrial over-center type lever which has considerable leverage so that the fan can be
    stopped instantly. The brake cable tension can be adjusted in the cockpit by rotating the brake lever handle.
</p>

<p>
    Micronair rotary atomizers may be installed if desired. The factory supplies a special boom for 8 atomizers.
</p>

    For dry materials a Transland p/n 22358 extra high-volume spreader is used. When the spreader is installed, the
    strainer should be rotated as required for clearance. For rapid changeover from spray to dry materials remove only
    the pump and booms. For extended fertilizer application it is suggested that the center boom assembly and control
    valve be removed to prevent fertilizer from getting into the valve assembly. This can be accomplished in only a few
    minutes by removing the stainless “T” pins, which support the center boom assembly and removing the two bolts that
    attach the valve to the stainless bracket.

    The Air Tractor features a near leak-proof hopper lid which allows full liquid loads to be carried. The leak-proof
    feature is made possible by a sturdy over-center latch assembly and a curved hopper top which allows the hopper lid
    to be pulled solidly into place. Medium density nitrile 3/8 x 1' wide is used for a hopper lid gasket. Four
    stainless over-center clamps help seal the fwd and aft lid edges.
</p>

<p>
    The hopper vent tube is welded 3" diameter stainless tubing inside the hopper. A 3" stainless ball is used to seal
    off the overboard vent when the liquid level reaches the top of the hopper. The vent tube protruding from the lower
    fuselage skin is made of aluminum and can be rotated to point forward to provide positive pressure in the hopper for
    dry material application. This slight pressurization in the hopper requires a little less gate opening for a given
    poundage which reduces the blockage effects of the door opening into the slipstream. When the vent tube is rotated
    to point aft, a slight negative pressure is created inside the hopper which prevents any fumes from escaping around
    the hopper lid gasket.
</p>

<p>
    Optional dropped booms may be ordered from the factory which lower the spray booms 8-inches and reduce the number of
    fine spray particles by as much as 50%. In areas where off-target drift is to be avoided, the dropped booms should
    be installed.
</p>

<p>
    Optional dispersal equipment includes a 3-inch spray system which utilizes the Agrinautics p/n 65715- 1 3-inch pump,
    3-inch plumbing to the pump, and 2 1/2-inch plumbing to the booms.
</p>

<p>
    Later models feature a trigger in the hopper vent tube that prevents the round stainless ball from floating up and
    closing off the vent before the hopper is completely filled. When the bottom load valve is closed, a cable which is
    attached to the valve handle releases the round ball and allows it to seal off the vent tube to minimize overflow
    out the vent system during takeoff.
</p>

<p>
    Right hand boom shut off is also available as an option from the factory. This feature gives the pilot greater
    control of swath placement.
</p>

<p>
    An optional spreader is the Transland 54401 NorCal Swathmaster which requires the p/n 24274 adapter box and the
    25-inch gate box.
