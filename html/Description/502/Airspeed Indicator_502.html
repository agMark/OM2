<p>The airspeed indicator is an aneroid-driven instrument that displays the indicated airspeed of the airplane. The instrument contains two aneroid bellows which compares the total pressure at the pitot tube with the static pressure at the airplane’s static ports. The result of this comparison yields the pure dynamic pressure obtained by subtracting static pressure from total pressure. This dynamic pressure is used to drive the hand on the face of the dial with markings shown in miles per hour or knots. <span style="color: red;">Paragraph has been edited.</span></p>
