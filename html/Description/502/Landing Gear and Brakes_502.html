Spring-type main and tail landing gear is used on the Air Tractor. This type of landing gear provides a minimum of maintenance, low drag and considerable energy absorption for hard landings. In addition, a smooth ride is provided for operations from rough strips.

The main gear axles are made of 4130N steel, and cadmium plated for corrosion protection. Tapered aluminum shims are used between the axle and the main gear leg to provide the proper camber and toe-in. The main gear wheels are Cleveland p/n 40-133 with a 29 x 11.00 10-ply rating tire installed. Main wheel tire inflation pressure is 50 psi (unloaded) or 52 psi (loaded).

The tail wheel is a Cleveland 40-168. A grease fitting is provided on the side of the wheel in order to grease the bearings.

The tail wheel tire is 5.00 x 5. with a 6-ply rating. Tire pressure is 50 psi loaded or unloaded.

The tail wheel fork is of welded 4130N tubing construction and is heat-treated for strength. Bronze bushings and a brass wear plate are incorporated where the fork enters the tail wheel housing. 

A tail wheel locking mechanism is provided, and the tail wheel may be unlocked by pushing the control stick forward or by operating the manual tail wheel lock lever. This lifts the stainless locking pin out of the tail wheel fork and allows the tail wheel assembly to swivel 360°.

The original tail wheel lock mechanism is adjusted by loosening the four screws that attach the lock pin housing to the fork housing plate. The SureLock mechanism is adjusted using the adjustment bolts at the front and back of the housing. These mechanisms are interchangeable. The SureLock mechanism may be retrofitted to all airplanes.

Brakes are the same, left or right, and are Cleveland p/n 30-98C. The brake cylinders are Cleveland p/n 10-23F. Brake fluid is the conventional red petroleum-based Mil-H-5606A fluid. The brake fluid reservoir is Volkswagen p/n 113611301L and is mounted on top of the lower instrument panel where the fluid level is always visible. The parking brake valve is a Scott p/n 4500A-2. Stratoflex hoses are used from the pressure side of the master cylinder to the parking brake valve and stainless steel lines are routed from the valve to the bulkhead fitting next to the main landing gear. A high-pressure Stratoflex hose connects the bulkhead fitting to the wheel cylinders. The schematic of the brake system is shown below in Figure 1-16.
