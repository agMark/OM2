    A spring type main and tail landing gear is used on the Air Tractor. This type of landing gear provides a minimum of
    maintenance, low drag and considerable energy absorption for hard landings. In addition, a smooth ride is provided
    for operations from rough strips.
</p>

<p>
    The main gear axles are made of alloy steel, and cadmium plated for corrosion protection. Tapered aluminum shims are
    used between the axle and the main gear leg to provide the proper camber and toe-in. The main gear wheels are
    Cleveland p/n 40-133 with a 29x11.00 10-ply rating tire installed. Main wheel tire inflation pressure is 50 psi
    (unloaded) or 52 psi (loaded).
</p>

<p>
    The tail wheel is a Cleveland 40-168. A grease fitting is provided in the side of the wheel in order to grease the
    bearings.
</p>

<p>
    The tail wheel tire is 5.00x5. Be sure it is 6-ply rating. Tire pressure is 50 psi loaded or unloaded.
</p>

    The tail wheel fork is of welded 4130N tubing construction and is heat-treated for strength. Bronze bushings and a
    brass wear plate are incorporated where the fork enters the tail wheel housing. A tail wheel locking mechanism is
    provided, and the tailwheel may be unlocked by pushing the control stick forward. This lifts the stainless locking
    pin out of the tail wheel fork and allows the tail wheel assembly to swivel 360˚. If during taxi the aircraft tends
    to steer to the left or to the right with the controls neutral, it is possible to readjust the lock pin position by
    loosening the 4 screws that attach the lock pin housing to the fork housing plate. The lock pin can then be moved in
    the desired direction and the screws tightened.

    Brake System
</b>

<p>
    Brakes are the same, left or right, and are Cleveland p/n 30-98C. The brake cylinders are Cleveland p/n 10-23F.
    Brake fluid is the conventional red petroleum-based Mil-H-5606A fluid. The brake fluid reservoir is a Volkswagen p/n
    113611301 L and is mounted on top of the lower instrument panel where the fluid level is always visible. The parking
    brake valve is a Scott p/n 4500A-2. Stratoflex hoses are used from the pressure side of the master cylinder to the
    parking brake valve and stainless-steel lines are routed from the valve to the bulkhead fitting next to the main
    landing gear. A high-pressure Stratoflex hose connects the bulkhead fitting to the wheel cylinders.
