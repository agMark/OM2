Spring-type main and tail landing gear are used on the Air Tractor. This type of landing gear provides a minimum of maintenance, low drag and considerable energy absorption for hard landings. In addition, a smoother ride is provided for operations from rough strips.

The main gear axles are made of 4130N steel, and cadmium plated for corrosion protection. Tapered aluminum shims are used between the axle and the main gear leg to provide the proper camber and toe-in. The main gear wheels are manufactured by Cleveland and a 29 x 11.00 10-ply rating tire installed. Main wheel tire inflation pressure is 50 psi (unloaded) or 52 psi (loaded).

The tail wheel has a grease fitting on the side of the wheel to grease the bearings and the tailwheel tire is 5.00 x 5. with a 6-ply rating. Tire pressure is 50 psi loaded or unloaded.

The tail wheel fork is of welded 4130N tubing construction and is heat-treated for strength. Bronze bushings and a brass wear plate are incorporated where the fork enters the tail wheel housing.

A tail wheel locking mechanism is provided, and the tail wheel may be unlocked by pushing the control stick forward or by operating the manual tail wheel lock lever. This lifts the stainless locking pin out of the tail wheel fork and allows the tail wheel assembly to swivel 360°.
<p></p>
The original tail wheel lock mechanism is adjusted by loosening the four screws that attach the lock pin housing to the fork housing plate. The SureLock mechanism is adjusted using the adjustment bolts at the front and back of the housing. These mechanisms are interchangeable. The SureLock mechanism may be retrofitted to all airplanes.

Brakes are identical on both sides of the aircraft. The brakes and brake cylinders are both made by Cleveland. Brake fluid is petroleum-based Mil-H-5606A and the brake fluid reservoir is mounted on top of the lower instrument panel to provide easy visiblity of the fluid level. The parking brake valve is made by Scott and Stratoflex hoses are used from the pressure side of the master cylinder to the parking brake valve. Stainless steel lines are routed from the valve to the bulkhead fitting next to the main landing gear. A high-pressure Stratoflex hose connects the bulkhead fitting to the wheel cylinders. The schematic of the brake system is shown below in Figure 1-16.
