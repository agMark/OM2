<p>The magnetic compass is a direct-reading instrument that senses the azimuth difference in airplane heading and a bearing to magnetic North. This difference is displayed at the lubber line of the compass as magnetic heading.

The compass is swung at the factory and a card is attached that shows the amount of compass error at each cardinal heading. The compass deviation is measured with radios and lights OFF. Operation of lights, radios or other electrical equipment may cause significant error in the compass.
