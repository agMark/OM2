The AT-502A/AT-502B/AT-504 have exceptional visibility on the ground as well as in the air. The AT-502A/AT-502B windshield is three pieces, the two corner pieces being Plexiglass while the flat center piece is automotive safety plate glass. The AT-504 uses a two-piece Plexiglass windshield. Cockpit entry is made through either of two large canopy doors. A wire deflector is incorporated into the windshield support structure. The cockpit layout and details are shown below in Figure 1-3, Figure 1-4 and Figure 1-5.

    The rudder pedals may be adjusted on the ground by removing the “T” pin and sliding the rudder pedals in the
    aluminum channel to the desired position and reinserting the “T” pin. 
    <p></p>The seat is fixed in one position at the factory. However, the operator may lower the seat if desired by removing the two pins and drilling new holes through the seat rail. The seat structure is of welded 4130N tubing, oiled internally, and sand-blasted, primed, and painted. The covers are removable and may be changed as required. The covers are of a coarse mesh material for comfort during hot weather. A special installation tool is required for installing new covers and may be borrowed from the local Air Tractor dealer. At the bottom extreme of the seat bucket, a tube structure supports a thick Ensonite pad.

    A three-inch-wide safety belt is attached to the structure. The shoulder harness is attached to the primary fuselage
    structure behind the cockpit. The shoulder harness is a necessary part of the restraint system and must always be
    worn.
<p>
If the aircraft is equipped with AmSafe airbags, these airbags are built into the shoulder harnesses. The airbag system is equipped with its own internal battery, so it is always active. There is no pilot action necessary to arm or operate the system. The airbag system requires the use of the installed crotch strap for proper pilot protection.

The control lock is located under the instrument panel. It hinges up to engage the tang on the control stick, effectively locking the aileron and elevator surfaces.

There are two instrument panel sections, with the upper panel containing the instruments most often used during flight. A large hopper window between the panels allows the pilot to determine the amount of dry fertilizer or seed remaining in the hopper. The instruments are described individually in Section 1.85.
<p></p>
A stall warning horn is provided and the lift detector on the wing is set to activate the horn at approximately 5 miles per hour above stall. A hopper quantity gauge is installed on the right-hand side of the upper instrument panel. This gauge is marked to read in U.S. gallons with the aircraft in ground attitude. In addition, the hopper is marked in 25 gallon increments where visible to ground crew.
<p></p>
The hopper window in the rear wall of the hopper is supported by an aluminum frame. It is sealed with PS890 B-2 sealant that is impervious to most chemicals and is available through Air Tractor dealers.
<p></p>
The cockpit has aluminum enclosure skins and control push-rod boots that isolate the cockpit from the rest of the aircraft and prevent the entry of most chemicals. If the aircraft is to be used for dusting, special modifications are required. See the Airplane Flight Manual for complete instructions on dust applications and modifications.
