    The AT-502A/-502B/504 has exceptional visibility on the ground as well as in the air. The AT-502A/-502B windshield
    is three pieces, the two corner pieces being Plexiglas while the flat center piece is automotive safety plate. The
    AT-504 uses a two-piece Plexiglas windshield. Cockpit entry is made through either of two large canopy doors. A wire
    deflector is incorporated into the windshield support structure.

    The rudder pedals may be adjusted on the ground by removing the “T” pin and sliding the rudder pedals in the
    aluminum channel to the desired position and reinserting the “T” pin. The seat is fixed in one position at the
    factory. However, the operator may lower the seat if desired by removing the two pins and drilling new holes through
    the seat rail. The seat structure is of welded 4130N tubing, oiled internally, and sand-blasted, primed, and
    painted. The covers are removable and may be changed as required. The covers are of a coarse mesh material for
    comfort during hot weather. A special installation tool is required for installing new covers and may be borrowed
    from the local Air Tractor dealer. At the bottom extreme of the seat a tube structure supports a thick Ensonite pad
    to protect the pilot should the covering material fail in a severe crash.

    A three-inch-wide safety belt is attached to the structure. The shoulder harness is attached to the primary fuselage
    structure behind the cockpit. The shoulder harness is a necessary part of the restraint system and must always be
    worn.
</p>

<p>
    If the aircraft is equipped with AmSafe Airbags, these airbags are built into the shoulder harnesses. The airbag
    system is equipped with its own internal battery, so it is always active. There is no pilot action necessary to arm
    or operate the system. The airbag system requires the use of the installed crotch strap for proper pilot protection.

    A control lock is located under the panel and hinges up to secure the control stick.

    The instrument panels are in two sections, with the upper panel containing the instruments most often used during
    flight. A large hopper window between the panels allows the pilot to determine the amount of dry fertilizer or seed
    remaining in the hopper. Instruments provided with the basic airplane include a sensitive altimeter, airspeed
    indicator, ITT gauge, oil temp gauge, oil pressure gauge, torquemeter, propeller tachometer, gas generator
    tachometer, compass, boom pressure gauge, fuel gauge, and voltmeter.

    A stall warning horn is provided and the lift detector on the wing is set to activate the horn at approximately 5
    miles per hour above stall. A hopper quantity gauge is installed on the right-hand side of the upper instrument
    panel. This gauge is marked to read in U.S. gallons with the aircraft in the ground attitude. In addition, the
    hopper is marked in 25-gallon increments where visible to ground crew.
</p>

<p>
    The hopper window in the rear wall of the hopper is supported with an aluminum frame and is sealed with silicone
    sealer which is impervious to most chemicals and is available at most industrial stores.

    The cockpit has aluminum enclosure skins and control push-rod boots which isolate the cockpit from the rest of the
    aircraft and prevent the entry of most chemicals. If the aircraft is to be used for dusting however, the operator
    should install boots about the rudder cables where they pass through the cockpit wall and re-seal small cracks and
    seams with silicon sealer. In addition, two additional small airscoops should be installed on the lower skin just
    aft of the firewall. These airscoops will provide a positive pressure in the fuselage to prevent dust from entering.
