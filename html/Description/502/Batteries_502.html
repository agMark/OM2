The batteries are Teledyne Gill Electric p/n G-246AT 24-volt lead-acid batteries and are wired in parallel for additional cranking power. The total capacity of the two batteries is 42 amp-hours or 63 amp-hours when three batteries are installed. The AT-502A uses three G-246AT batteries when a PT6A-45R/-60AG/-65AG engine is installed or two G-246AT batteries when a PT6A-140AG engine is installed. A ground start receptacle is installed on the left-hand side of the lower cowling--the external power supply should be used for starting at any time batteries show a state of charge of less than 24 volts. Fully charged batteries should allow the gas generator to peak at about 18% Ng before the START control lever is advanced to the RUN position. At this high of an Ng speed, a desirable cool start is possible.
