    The AT-502A/502B/504 uses a gas-cycle air conditioning system for climate control in the most adverse temperature
    and humidity situations. The functional layout of the air-conditioning system is shown in Drawing 60749.
</p>

<p>
    This versatile air conditioning system allows the pilot to select ram air from outside, or to recirculate cockpit
    air, or a combination of the two. The ram-air control handle is located on the aft-cockpit wall, to the right-hand
    side of the pilot.
</p>

<p>
    All control switches for the air conditioning system are located on the pilot's panel. The pilot can use the main
    switch to turn the air conditioner ON or OFF or to enable only the evaporative blower fan. The evaporative blower
    switch is used to control the blower speed as HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW.

    The Sanden SD-508 compressor has five reciprocating pistons driven by a rotating wobble-plate. It uses reed-type
    valves to control flow at the suction and pressure ports. It is powered by an engine drive pad. Gears in the engine
    pad drive a splined quill shaft that turns a small two-sheave pulley. This small pulley drives the larger flywheel
    pulley with a flat serpentine belt. The belt is Goodyear p/n 4080220 and is specially made for Air Tractor. This
    larger drive pulley is connected, through an electromagnetic clutch, to the compressor shaft.

    In Drawing 60749, hot, high pressure, gaseous refrigerant leaves the pressure port of the compressor and goes to the
    upper inlet of the condenser coil. While in the condenser coil, the refrigerant is cooled at high pressure by the
    condenser fans. The temperature drop in the condenser coil causes the gas to liquefy. The refrigerant emerges from
    the bottom of the condenser coil as a warm liquid under high pressure.
</p>

<p>
    Next, the warm liquid passes to the receiver/dryer. The receiver/dryer acts as an accumulator to dampen pressure
    pulses from the compressor. It also removes moisture from the system, preventing internal freeze-up of the expansion
    valve.
</p>

<p>
    From the receiver/dryer, the warm liquid goes to the inlet of the block expansion valve. The expansion valve
    throttles the flow of warm liquid, dropping its pressure and temperature, transforming it to a cold gas.
</p>

<p>
    The cold gas goes from the expansion valve to the inlet of the evaporator coil where it is warmed by removing heat
    from the air drawn through the coil by the evaporator blower. This cooled air is ducted to the eyeball vent on
    either side of the pilot. These vents are adjustable so that the pilot can direct the cool air as desired.
</p>

<p>
    The refrigerant leaves the evaporator coil as a warm gas. This warm gas flows from the evaporator coil back through
    the outlet port of the block expansion valve and then returns to the suction port of the compressor where the
    compressor raises the pressure and temperature. The hot gas leaves the pressure port of the compressor, and the
    process starts over.
</p>

<p>
    The wiring schematic for the air-conditioning system is shown in Drawing 60748. The air conditioner fans, blowers,
    and compressor clutch are powered by the airplane bus. Mechanical power to drive the compressor is taken from an
    engine accessory drive pad.
</p>

    The Trinary Switch, located atop the receiver/dryer, does two things to control electrical power to the compressor
    clutch. A set of contacts in the Trinary Switch protects the compressor by opening the Compressor Clutch circuit any
    time the system's high pressure is less than 25 psi. This same set of contacts opens when the system's high pressure
    exceeds 350 psi.
