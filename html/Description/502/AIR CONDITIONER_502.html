The AT-502/504 aircraft use a gas-cycle air-conditioning system for climate control. This versatile air conditioning system allows the pilot to select ram air from outside, or to re-circulate cockpit air or a combination of the two. The ram-air control handle is located on the aft-cockpit wall, to the right-hand side of the pilot.
</p>
The Sanden SD-508 compressor has five reciprocating pistons driven by a rotating wobble-plate. It uses reed-type valves to control flow at the suction and pressure ports. Mechanical power to drive the compressor is taken from an engine accessory drive pad. Gears in the engine drive a splined-quill shaft that turns a small two-sheave pulley. This small pulley drives the larger flywheel pulley with a flat serpentine belt. This larger drive pulley is connected, through an electromagnetic clutch, to the compressor shaft.
</p>
The wiring schematic for this air-conditioning system is shown in Figure 1-1 below. The air conditioner fans, blowers and compressor clutch are powered by the airplane bus. All control switches for the air conditioning system are located on the pilot's instrument panel. The pilot can use the switches to turn the system ON or OFF and to select the cockpit-blower speed as HIGH, MED or LOW.

The air conditioner master switch (A/C Switch) controls all functions of the system. This switch may be used to select blower-only air circulation or provide conditioned air for the cockpit.
</p>
The Blower Switch controls the speed of the evaporator blower. The blower fan runs anytime that the A/C Switch is in a position other than OFF. Fan speed is controlled by selecting HIGH, MED, or LOW with the Blower Switch.
</p>
The Trinary Switch (located on top of the receiver/dryer) controls electrical power to the compressor clutch--a set of contacts in the switch protect the compressor by opening the compressor clutch circuit any time the system pressure is less than 25 psi or exceeds 350 psi.

The functional layout of this air-conditioning system is shown in Figure 1-2 below. In operation, high temperature, high pressure refrigerant vapor leaves the pressure port of the compressor and goes directly to the upper inlet of the condenser coil. While in the condenser coil, the refrigerant cools as the condenser fans located on the right side of the fuselage interior conduct heat away from the unit. This temperature drop in the condenser coil causes the gas to liquefy, with the refrigerant emerging from the lower end of the condenser coil as a warm liquid remaining under high pressure.

The receiver/dryer acts as an accumulator to dampen pressure pulses from the compressor. The receiver/dryer also removes moisture and any solid debris from the system, preventing internal freeze-up of the expansion valve.
</p>
The flow of the warm liquid is directed to the cooling unit consisting of an expansion valve, evaporator coil and electrically powered fan.
</p>
The expansion valve meters the flow of warm liquid, dropping its pressure and transforming it to a cold, saturated vapor.
</p>
The cold gas proceeds from the expansion valve to the evaporator coil where it absorbs heat from the air forced through the coil by an electric fan. This conditioned, cold air blown across the evaporator coil is then routed to the cockpit.
</p>
The refrigerant leaves the evaporator coil as a warm vapor. The vapor flow from the cooling unit returns to the suction port of the compressor where the compressor again raises its pressure and temperature. This hot and high pressure gas leaves the pressure port of the compressor, and the process starts over again.
