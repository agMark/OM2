    The wing structure is full cantilever, with the main spar carrying all of the bending loads. Construction is of
    2024-T3 alclad for skins and spar webs. The upper spar cap is also 2024-T3 material, but the lower spar cap is made
    of alloy steel for a long fatigue life. The wing has a constant chord of 72 inches and a span of 52.0 ft. The wing
    utilizes a NACA 4415 wing section and has 2 degrees of washout twist.

    The leading edge is extra heavy with a leading-edge doubler bonded internally to minimize denting. Each wing panel
    has the leading edge divided into five different pieces to allow easy replacement. Universal head rivets are used to
    facilitate the removal and replacement of leading-edge sections.

    The fuel tanks are located in the inboard section of the wing and are an integral part of the structure. The closely
    riveted seams and heavy skins make them burst resistant in the event of a crash. Sealing is accomplished by an
    application of Courtalds Aerospace PR-1442 Class A and Class B sealing compound*. The inboard end of the wing is
    sealed against chemical entry and the aileron pushrod has a flexible boot attached to prevent entry of chemical at
    the pushrod location. A complete wire bundle for night working lights is installed inside the wing during assembly
    so that lights may be added at a later date.

    The upper spar cap is painted with yellow polyurethane paint and the lower spar is cadmium plated and primed for
    corrosion protection. All other parts inside the wing are treated with Alodine and primed prior to assembly.

    * Alternate sealers are Morton Aerospace MC-236 Class A and Class B, AC-Tech AC-236 Class A and Class B, PRC DeSoto
    International P/S 890 Class A and Class B, and AC-Tech AC250 Class A and Class B.
