The Air Tractor AT-502A/502B/504 is an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane designed specifically for agricultural operations. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney PT6A turboprop engine, which is highly suited for this type of flight operation. The standard engine for the AT-502B is the PT6A-15AG (680 SHP) while the alternate engine for the AT-502B is the PT6A-34AG (750 SHP). The PT6A-34AG engine is also the standard installation for the AT-504. Installation losses are very low, and full horsepower can usually be obtained at sea level temperatures up to 71o F for the -15AG engine and up to 87o F for the -34AG engine. The AT-502A may be equipped with any of the following engines: the PT6A-140AG (867 SHP), the PT6A-60AG (1050 SHP), the PT6A-65AG (1100 SHP) or the PT6A-45R (flat rated at 1100 SHP). The marketing term for a AT-502A equipped with the PT6A-140AG engine is the "502XP".

The propeller for the 502B/504 is a Hartzell three-blade 106” diameter constant speed prop with reversing capabilities. The 502A equipped with the PT6A-140AG engine drives a Hartzell 4-blade 108” diameter constant speed propeller with reversing capabilities. All other 502A airplanes are equipped with a Hartzell 5-blade 111” diameter constant speed propeller with reversing capabilities. The hopper is made of fiberglass and has a 500-gallon (U.S.) capacity. The horizontal stabilizer is all metal and strut-braced for added rigidity and the vertical fin is fully cantilevered. The elevators and rudder are of all-metal construction and sealed to prevent chemical entry. The fuselage features removable skin panels for ease of maintenance and cleaning. High-efficiency flaps are installed and interconnected with the ailerons to provide extremely short take-off and landing distances.
