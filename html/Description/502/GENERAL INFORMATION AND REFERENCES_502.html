    The Air Tractor AT-502A/502B/504 is an all-metal Cantilever low-wing monoplane designed especially
    for agricultural operations. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney PT6A turboprop engine which is highly suited
    to ag flying. The standard engine for the AT-502B is the PT6A-15AG which is rated at 680 SHP. The
    alternate engine for the AT-502B is the PT6A-34AG which is rated at 750 SHP. The PT6A-34AG engine is
    standard for the AT-504. Installation losses are very low and the full horsepower can usually be obtained at
    sea level temperatures up to 71°
    for the -15AG and up to 87°
    for the -34AG engines. The AT-502A can be
    equipped with any of the following engines: the PT6A-140AG rated at 867 SHP, the PT6A-60AG rated at
    1050 SHP, the PT6A-65AG rated at 1100 SHP, or the PT6A-45R flat rated at 1100 SHP. The marketing
    term for the AT-502A with the PT6A-140AG engine is the "502XP".

    The propeller for the 502B/504 is a Hartzell three-blade 106 inch diameter constant speed prop with 
    reversing capabilities. The 502A with the PT6A-140AG engine is equipped with a Hartzell 4-Blade 108-inch 
    diameter constant speed propeller with reversing capabilities. All other 502A airplanes are equipped with a 
    Hartzell 5-blade 111-inch diameter constant speed propeller with reversing capabilities. The hopper is made 
    of fiberglass and has a 500 gallon (U.S.) capacity. The horizontal stabilizer is all metal and strut-braced for 
    added rigidity. The vertical fin is cantilever. The elevators and rudder are of all-metal construction and 
    sealed to prevent chemical entry. The fuselage features removable skin panels for ease of maintenance and 
    cleaning. High-lift flaps are incorporated and are interconnected with the ailerons to provide extremely short 
    take-off and landing distances
