The propeller lever may be placed in the full forward position during the start sequence for more convenient movement for the start lever providing the temperatures are warm. For cold weather starts the prop lever should be aft, as called out in the starting instructions, as initial oil pressure will go to engine bearings instead of the propeller dome.
