A quadrant on the left-hand side of the cockpit incorporates the Power lever, the Propeller control lever, and the Start control lever. The AT-504 has an additional power lever on the right-hand side of the cockpit.

There are two types of quadrants:

•	Standard Air Tractor Quadrant
•	Kawak Quadrant

These quadrants are described in the following sections.

All engine controls utilize push-pull cable assemblies. These cable assemblies have very little friction and require no lubrication. See Figure 1-9 for the layout of engine controls.

The Propeller lever may be placed in the full forward position during the start sequence for more convenient movement for the Start lever providing the temperatures are warm. For cold weather starts the Prop lever should be aft, as called out in the starting instructions, as initial oil pressure will go to engine bearings instead of the propeller dome.
