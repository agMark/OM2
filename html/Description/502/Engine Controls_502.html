    A quadrant on the left-hand side of the cockpit incorporates the Power lever, the Propeller control lever, and the
    Start control lever. The Power lever has an idle stop and cannot be moved into the reverse range without moving the
    trigger at the top of the lever forward. Do not allow the power lever to be moved into the reverse range unless the
    engine is running or else the control linkage could be damaged. The AT-504 has an additional power lever on the
    right-hand side of the cockpit.

    The Start lever has a latch that prevents inadvertent movement below the “Run” position that would shut off the fuel
    in flight. The Start lever should always be in the “Flight Idle” position during flight to allow the engine to
    remain spooled up enough during approach to allow quick acceleration in case a go-around is required. Refer to the
    Start Procedures in the Flight Manual for proper positioning of the Start lever when starting. It is important to
    remember that only with the Start lever full back at the most aft stop position is the fuel cut off.

    The Propeller lever may be placed in the full forward position during the start sequence for more convenient
    movement for the Start lever providing the temperatures are warm. For cold weather starts the Prop lever should be
    aft, as called out in the starting instructions, as initial oil pressure will go to engine bearings instead of the
    propeller dome.

    All engine controls utilize push-pull cable assemblies. These AT-502B cable assemblies are p/n 66-3635-2112 for the
    Power and Start Control and p/n 66-3635-2170 for the Propeller control. These cables have very little friction and
    require no lubrication. The AT-502A with PT6A-45R/-60AG/-65AG engines uses a p/n 66-3635-2089 cable for the Power
    and Start controls, and p/n 66-3635-2196 for the Prop control. The AT-504 cable assembly is P/N 66-3635-2089 for the
    power, start, and propeller controls. The AT-502A with the PT6A-140AG engine uses the Orscheln p/n 38004804 cable
    for Power and Start controls and the Orscheln p/n 38004702 cable for the Propeller control.
