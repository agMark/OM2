    The fuselage structure is of heli-arc welded 4130N steel tubing. All fittings and bushings are also of 4130N steel.
    Fuselage repairs may be made in accordance with appropriate FAA repair procedures and gas welding is permissible.
    There are no heat-treated members in the fuselage. The front section of the fuselage from the rear spar forward and
    including the engine mount have been oven stress-relieved in order to prevent stress concentrations from the welding
    operation. For corrosion control oil passage holes are drilled at the intersections of all tubes and clusters. Hot
    linseed oil is then pumped into the fuselage frame and drained. This oil adheres to the inside walls of the tubing.
    The exterior of the fuselage frame is then sand- blasted and painted with AG Air Yellow Epoxy which is resistant to
    nearly all chemical action.

    The fuselage lower and upper skins are attached to the fuselage frame with stainless screws and nuts. The fuselage
    side panels are of heavy gauge 2024-T3 alclad or 6061-T6 and are attached to stainless camloc receptacles. This
    allows the side panels to be removed in minutes, leaving the fuselage frame open for thorough cleaning and
    inspection. All skins are mounted with clearance between the skin and the fuselage tubing so that chemicals will not
    collect and cause corrosion.
