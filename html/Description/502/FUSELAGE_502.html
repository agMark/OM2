The fuselage structure is of Heliarc-welded 4130N steel tubing. All fittings and bushings are also of 4130N steel. Fuselage repairs may be made in accordance with appropriate repair procedures and gas welding is permissible except in the area of the main landing gear structure. Advisory Circular (AC) 43-13-1A provides adequate FAA -approved guidance for fuselage repairs.

The 4130N tubes of the main landing gear support structure are welded with 4130 rod and heat treated for strength. Generally, no weld repairs are allowed in this area unless specifically authorized.

The front section of the fuselage from the rear spar forward and including the engine mount have been oven stress-relieved in order to prevent stress concentrations from the welding operation. <span style="color: red;">(Does the 500 series have this area heat treated? </span> For corrosion control oil passage holes are drilled at the intersections of all tubes and clusters. Hot linseed oil is then pumped into the fuselage frame and drained. This oil adheres to the inside walls of the tubing. The exterior of the fuselage frame is then sand-blasted and painted with AG Air Yellow Epoxy which is resistant to nearly all chemical action.

The fuselage lower and upper skins are attached to the fuselage frame with stainless screws and nuts. The fuselage side panels are of heavy gauge 2024-T3 alclad or 6061-T6 and are attached to stainless Camloc receptacles. This allows the side panels to be removed in minutes, leaving the fuselage frame open for thorough cleaning and inspection. All skins are mounted with clearance between the skin and the fuselage tubing so that chemicals will not collect and cause corrosion.
