The 502B/504 exhaust pipes are Air Tractor p/n 50597-3 (L/H) and p/n 50670-1 (R/H). These pipes are attached with stainless MS20034-1 bolts, MS20500-428 nuts, and AN960C416 washers. The AT-502A uses p/n 51238-7 (L/H) and p/n 51238-6 (R/H) exhaust pipes when the PT6A-45R, -60AG, or -65AG engines are installed. AT-502A aircraft with the PT6A-140AG engine use Air Tractor p/n 50597-3 (L/H) and p/n 50670-1 (R/H) exhaust pipes. There are exhaust covers provided with each aircraft and these covers should be installed when the engine has cooled down.
