<p style='color:black;'>The fuel gauges indicate the fuel quantity in each of the wing tanks. The input signal to the gauges allows the reading of fuel quantity in both the left-hand wing tank and the right-hand wing tank. The gauges do not display total fuel quantity.

Each fuel gauge is a micro-ammeter that displays amperage signals from potentiometers that are attached to float arms in the fuel tanks. The faces of the gauges are calibrated in divisions that show fuel quantity in fractions of the FULL reading.
