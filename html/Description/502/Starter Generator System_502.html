The starter-generator system produces and controls all electrical power for the aircraft. It works with the system's batteries and generator-control unit (GCU) to power the electrical buses. All electrical sub-systems receive their power from buses that are fed by the starter-generator system.
</p>
The 502/504 series aircraft are equipped with a 250-amp Lear-Siegler p/n 23048-021 28-volt starter-generator and use a p/n 23046-520 QAD mounting kit. There is an optional wet spline Lear-Siegler (Lucas) p/n 23048-028 starter-generator using the p/n 23078-010 QAD. Another optional starter-generator is the Aircraft Parts Corp. 250SG112Q which uses the 250SG1083-3 QAD. The system is derated to a 150-amp system by using a 150-amp PDLM-150 circuit breaker. The voltage regulator is a Precision Airmotive p/n 42-1001, and the starter and master relays are Cutler-Hammer p/n 6041H202A. An alternative relay is the Kissling p/n 29-314-12-903.

</p>
Figure 1-8 above shows the schematic for the 250-amp charging system. The 250-amp system is a standard part of the AT-502 and AT-504 series. The system consists of:
</p>
    1.	The Starter/Generator (S/G) - the armature is continuously engaged in the engine's accessory gear box. The S/G functions as an electric    motor for starting the engine and then as an engine driven DC Generator.
    2.	The Generator Control Unit (GCU) - The GCU is located under the cockpit floor.
    3.	The Line Contactor Relay (LCR) - located on the right side of the firewall.
    4.	The Start Relay - located on the right side of the firewall.
    5.	The Start Switch (ST SW) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.
    6.	The Generator Switch (GEN SW) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.
    7.	The Pilots Panel Voltmeter (VM) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.
    8.	The Low Voltage Warning Light (LV LITE) - located on the Upper Instrument Panel (when equipped)
    9.	15 Amp GCU Circuit Breaker (15A C/B) - located on the right lower engine mount tube just ahead of the firewall.
