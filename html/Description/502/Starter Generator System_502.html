<p>
    Refer to your parts manual and to schematic found in this manual, the system consists of:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The Starter/Generator (S/G) - the armature is continuously engaged in the engine's accessory gear box. The S/G
        functions as an electric motor for starting the engine and then as an engine driven DC Generator.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Generator Control Unit (GCU) - The GCU is located under the cockpit floor.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Line Contactor Relay (LCR) - located on the right side of the firewall.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Start Relay - located on the right side of the firewall.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Start Switch (ST SW) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Generator Switch (GEN SW) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Pilots Panel Voltmeter (VM) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Low Voltage Warning Light (LV LITE) - located on the Upper Instrument Panel (when equipped)
    </li>
    <li>
        15 Amp GCU Circuit Breaker (15A C/B) - located on the right lower engine mount tube just ahead of the firewall.
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="boldText">Theory of Operation</p>

<p>
    Starting - Actuating the Start Switch energizes the Start Relay which applies battery voltage to term C of the S/G
    which operates as a series-wound DC motor. Note that at the same time battery voltage is applied to pin N of the GCU
    which signals it to remove field excitation from the S/G. The purpose of this feature is to prevent the poor start
    performance that would otherwise result if the Generator Switch were left in the ON position.
</p>

<p>
    Note: It is recommended that the Generator Switch be in the OFF position during START because of the high inrush
    current to the batteries immediately upon Start termination will result in higher-than-normal gas temperature (ITT).
    It is better to allow the engine to stabilize at Ground Idle before turning the Generator Switch ON.
</p>

<p>
    Generator Mode - Following engine starting and prior to turning the Generator Switch ON (The engine at ground idle)
    the voltage output of the S/G (Terminal B) should be .5 to 1.5 volts. This is a residual voltage that results from
    residual magnetism in the S/G even though the field excitation from the GCU is Zero. Turning the Generator Switch ON
    causes this residual voltage to be applied to pin J, which the GCU in turn outputs on pin M. As a result, the S/G
    output will build up rapidly and stabilize at the 27.5 V voltage setting of the GCU (externally adjusted from 26 to
    30 volts). Sensing for Voltage Regulation is between pins B and G.
</p>

<p>
    Line Contact Relay (LCR) Control - The GCU monitors the S/G output and the Bus Voltage on pins B and A respectively.
    As the S/G voltage builds up to within approximately .2 volts of the Bus voltage the GCU will output system voltage
    on pin H resulting in activation of the LCR. Power for this circuit is derived from pin J so turning the Generator
    Switch OFF disables the LCR as well as the S/G.
</p>

<p>
    Reverse Current Protection - If the S/G voltage drops below the Bus voltage (battery) due to normal conditions such
    as engine shutdown or abnormal conditions such as loss of field excitation the S/G will draw reverse current
    (discharge the battery). The GCU senses this condition via pin D which is connected to terminal D of the S/G.
    Terminal D output is a positive voltage proportional to reverse current.
</p>

<p>
    Overvoltage (OV) Protection - In the event that system faults occur, either internal or external to the GCU, that
    results in over-excitation of the S/G the OV circuit will prevent the Bus voltage from going above approximately 32
    volts. This protection is accomplished by a "Crowbar" circuit in the GCU which internally shorts pin J to D. This
    results in immediate removal of voltage from the S/G field and the LCR coil. At the same time high current flow
    through the 15A C/B causing it to trip. The OV Circuit has a time delay to prevent nuisance trips due to system
    transients.
