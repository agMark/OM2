The starter-generator system produces and controls all electrical power for the aircraft. It works with the system's batteries and generator-control unit (GCU) to power the electrical buses. All electrical sub-systems receive their power from buses that are fed by the starter-generator system.

The 502/504 series aircraft are equipped with a 250-amp Lear-Siegler 28-volt starter-generator and uses a QAD mounting kit. There is an optional wet spline Lear-Siegler (Lucas) starter-generator and QAD available for installation. Another optional starter-generator is manufactured by Aircraft Parts Corporation. <span style="color: red;">(part numbers have been removed and paragraph edited)</span>

The system is derated to a 150-amp system by using a 150-amp circuit breaker. The voltage regulator is made by Precision Airmotive and the starter/master relays are manufactured by Cutler-Hammer. An alternative relay is available from Kissling. <span style="color: red;">(part numbers have been removed and paragraph edited)</span>

Figure 1-8 above shows the schematic for the 250-amp charging system. The 250-amp system is a standard part of the AT-502 and AT-504 series. The system consists of:
</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>The Starter/Generator (S/G) - the armature is continuously engaged in the engine's accessory gear box. The S/G functions as an electric motor for starting the engine and then as an engine driven DC Generator.</li>
    <li>The Generator Control Unit (GCU) - The GCU is located under the cockpit floor.</li>
<li> The Line Contactor Relay (LCR) - located on the right side of the firewall.</li>
<li> The Start Relay - located on the right side of the firewall.</li>
<li> The Start Switch (ST SW) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.</li>
<li> The Generator Switch (GEN SW) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.</li>
<li> The Pilots Panel Voltmeter (VM) - located on the Lower Instrument Panel.</li>
<li> The Low Voltage Warning Light (LV LITE) - located on the Upper Instrument Panel (when equipped)</li>
<li> 15 Amp GCU Circuit Breaker (15A C/B) - located on the right lower engine mount tube just ahead of the firewall.</li>
