<p>The Air Tractor Throttle Quadrant was the standard installation until approximately 2020. This quadrant is identifiable by the pistol style grip and two round prop and condition levers as shown below in Figure 1-10.
<p></p>
The power lever has an idle stop and cannot be moved into the reverse range without moving the trigger at the top of the lever forward. Do not allow the power lever to be moved into the reverse range unless the engine is running or else the control linkage could be damaged.
<p></p>
The start lever has a latch that prevents inadvertent movement below the RUN position that would shut off the fuel in flight. The Start lever should always be in the FLIGHT IDLE position during flight to allow the engine to remain spooled up enough during approach to allow quick acceleration in case a go-around is required. Refer to the Start Procedures in the Flight Manual for proper positioning of the start lever when starting. It is important to remember that only with the start lever full back at the aftmost stop position is the fuel cut off.
