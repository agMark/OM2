<p>The torquemeter presents a measure of the engine's output torque in pound-feet of torque. As engine torque varies, the helically-ground gears in the planet set cause the planetary gear carrier to push axially against a piston that is fitted into an oil-fill cylinder. The cylinder is pressurized by engine oil via a tap into the engine oil galley. This pressurized oil is allowed to escape from the cylinder through a bleed slot in the cylinder wall. As the piston is pushed into the cylinder, it progressively covers more of the bleed slot, restricting oil flow out of the cylinder and raising the oil pressure in the cylinder. This oil pressure, though gauged in PSI values, is displayed as pound-feet of torque by the Bourdon tube in the torquemeter.

Engine torque and operating limits are marked on the face of the torquemeter gauge. These markings represent the true torque limits as converted from psi units as gauged in the torque-measuring cylinder. See the appropriate airplane flight manual for a complete description of the specific engine torque limits.
