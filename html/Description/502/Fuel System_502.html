    Standard 502B/504 aircraft have two fuel tanks with a capacity of 85 U.S. gallons each. Both tanks gravity feed into
    a small header tank which is located behind the chemical hopper and below the rear spar attach tube. Optional fuel
    capacity is either 216 or 234 gallons for the 502B/504. The 502A standard fuel capacity is 216 gallons.
</p>
<p>
    The fuel valve handle is located within easy reach of the pilot and is marked “Main” and “Off”. There can be no tank
    selection since both tanks are interconnected. The fuel valve is placarded in “Gallons Usable”. The fuel gauge
    receiver, which is located on the instrument panel, is marked in fractions of usable fuel.
</p>
<p>
    Finger strainers of coarse wire mesh are located in each fuel tank. Fuel flows from the wing tanks into the header
    tank, through the fuel valve and to the airplane firewall. From the firewall, a fuel line is connected to a large
    fuel filter. This fuel filter may be either a Fram FS1133-PLM or Air Tractor p/n 53114-1 fuel filter (AT-502A model
    aircraft use a 53114-2 fuel filter). All fuel filters use an Air Tractor p/n 52351-1 fuel filter element. The p/n
    52351-1 fuel filter element should be cleaned at 100-hour intervals or as required, depending on how clean the fuel
    is that is being used. A vacuum pressure switch is connected to the outlet side of the filter. If the filter becomes
    clogged, the switch will close and the “FUEL FILTER” warning light will illuminate in the cockpit.

<p>
    The fuel filter screen is removed by removing the center bolt on top of the firewall-mounted filter unit. The steel
    filter bowl and screen can then be dropped off. The fuel in the bowl should be examined for sediment or water and
    the filter screen cleaned or replaced if necessary. (See S/L #229 and S/L #229A).
</p>

<p>
    When the fuel filter bowl has been removed for screen inspection it must be remembered that the fuel lines from the
    engine fuel control to the header tank have been drained, and these lines will be air-locked if a start is attempted
    without first priming the lines with fuel. Use the electric boost pump for this.
</p>

<p>
    The fuel lines continue from the firewall mounted fuel filter to the airframe pump, which is mounted on the engine
    vacuum drive pad. This pump is P/N 51076-1, set for CCW rotation. The elbow on the discharge side of the airframe
    pump is modified to accept installation of a 15 psi pressure switch (p/n M4003-15).
</p>

<p>
    The airframe pump has a pressure adjustment that has been set at the factory for approximately 18 psi with the
    engine operating at 80% power. If a new airframe pump is installed, and if a negative pressure is read on start-up,
    it is a sign that the airframe pump is not set up for proper rotation, and the body of the pump can be removed and
    rotated 180° to obtain a positive reading. The engine manufacturer requires that a minimum pressure of 5 psi is
    being delivered to the fuel control at all times, with a maximum pressure of 20 psi. The fuel pressure switch and
    warn light has been installed so that if the fuel pressure warn light comes on, or if fuel pressure drops below 15
    psi, the electric fuel boost pump should be turned on. The pilot should land as soon as possible and investigate.
    Possible cause of a drop in fuel pressure would be a dirty fuel filter, or loose fuel line.
</p>

<p>
    The fuel lines continue from the airframe pump to the fuel heater body. Lines from that point on are furnished with
    the engine.
</p>

<p>
    There are four quick drains in the fuel system: one in each wing tank, one in the header tank and one in the fuel
    valve. These drains should be activated daily. It is good practice to pass the fuel from these drains through a
    clean white rag held in the hand so that a check can be made on the spot as to the cleanliness of the fuel and
    evidence of water.
</p>

<p>
    Each fuel tank has an overboard vent located near the wing tip. With both tanks completely full, it is possible
    during flight to vent a small amount of fuel overboard by skidding the aircraft or rolling sharply.
</p>

<p>
    Fuel type is called out in the Flight Manual. Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII) such as Prist should be added to
    the fuel at a rate to provide .06% to .15% of FSII by volume when operating below 40° F.

    An optional ferry fuel system (hopper fuel) may be installed by following the procedures and using the parts
    described on drawing 50280-4.
