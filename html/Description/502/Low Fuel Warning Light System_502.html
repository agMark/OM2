<p><span style="color: red;">AT-802 and AT-802A aircraft, beginning with s/n 802-0072 are equipped with a low fuel warning system.</span> This system consists of a pair of float switches, one mounted in the inboard end of each wing tank. The switches are wired either in parallel to a single caution indicator light located on the upper instrument panel or to two separate indicator lights.
<p></p>
When the low fuel warning light first flickers on, during straight and level constant-speed flight, there is approximately 20 minutes of total fuel remaining. These remaining minutes will vary depending on aircraft attitude and engine power setting. <span style="color: red;">(does the 502 series have this installed?) Paragraphs copied from 802OM.</span>
