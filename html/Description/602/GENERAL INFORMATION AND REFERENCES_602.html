    The Air Tractor AT-602 is an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane designed especially for 
    agricultural or fire fighting operations. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney PT6A turboprop engine 
    which are highly suited for this type of flying. The standard engine is the PT6A-60 AG or PT6A-45R which
     are rated at 1050 SHP. Alternate engines are from the PT6A-65 series which are flat 
    rated at 1050 SHP.

    The propeller is a Hartzell five-blade 111-inch diameter constant speed prop with reversing 
    capabilities. The hopper is made of fiberglass and has a 630 gallon (U.S.) capacity. The horizontal 
    stabilizer is all metal and strut-braced for added rigidity. The vertical fin is cantilevered. The 
    elevators and rudder are of all-metal construction and sealed to prevent chemical entry. The 
    fuselage features removable skin panels for ease of maintenance and cleaning. High-lift flaps are 
    interconnected to the ailerons to provide short take-off and landing distances.
