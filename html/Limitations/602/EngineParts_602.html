    The Pratt & Whitney PT6A engine has several life limited components. P&W Service Bulletin
    13002 Revision No. 19, or later revision, describes the life limited components, and their limits for
    the PT6A-45 series engines. Service Bulletin 13002 Revision No. 9, or later revision, describes
    the life limited components, and their limits for the PT6A-65 series engines. Service Bulletin
    13202 Revision No. 3, or later revision, describes the life limited components, and their limits for
    the PT6A-60AG Series engines. As outlined in these service bulletins operators are required to
    keep records of accumulated total cycles and all starts and flight for their engines to determine
    when the service life of life limited components has expired.
