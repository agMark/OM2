<p>The wiring schematic for the stall warning horn is shown in <xref fileTarget="StallWarningSwitchSch.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below. The horn is connected in series with the lift-detector switch that is located near the leading edge of a mid-span of the left-hand wing. </p>

<p>The lift-detector switch is controlled by a tab that projects forward into the airstream. When at rest, gravity holds the tab down, creating an open circuit. When the airflow around the lift detector shifts to an upward direction, the tab is lifted, closing the switch and causing the horn to sound. </p>
