<p><b>Dump Handle Grip Inspection and Replacement</b></p>
<p>
    The grip should be replaced if it is found to be degraded or damaged 
    or impinging on the release button.
</p>

<p>
    To remove the grip, you will likely need to cut it lengthwise then peel. Depending on the 
    existence and security of adhesive, scraping and sanding may be required. Once the old grip is 
    completely removed, replace it as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Remove the red button by rotating counterclockwise. The button is retained with Loctite so 
        it may be somewhat difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply 3M Interior Trim (08088) or equivalent spray adhesive and slide the new grip onto the 
        handle until the top flange bottoms out against the handle
    </li>
    <li>
         Allow adhesive to cure for at least 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reinstall the release button with Loctite 242 (blue) ensuring that the button is not threaded 
        too far. Button should be installed with a minimum of three full turns but not so far that it 
        impinges on the handle or grip. Verify that there is at least 1/8 inch of clearance between the 
        button and grip/handle when the release is activated.
