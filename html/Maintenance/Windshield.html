<p><b>Cleaning</b></p>
<p>The safety-glass center windshield can be cleaned with a soft rag and any good glass cleaner. </p>
<p>
    For the plexiglass portion of the windshield be careful to always use a clean, soft cotton or microfiber rag (never a paper towel) 
    and plastic windshield cleaner to prevent scratches. There are several commercially available products for cleaning plastic such as Plexus, 
    All Kleer, and Clear View.  A mixture of equal parts water and hydrogen peroxide also makes a good plastic windshield cleaner. 
     DO NOT use any cleaner that contains ammonia or the plexiglass will be damaged.  
     It is also important to clean the windshield by gently rubbing the surface up and down, not in a circular motion.  
     Cleaning in a circular motion may cause a halo effect on your windshield.
</p>

<p><b>Plexiglass Cracks</b></p>
<p>
    If a crack is found near one of the attaching screws, stop-drill with a no. 30 drill bit that is specifically designed for plexiglass. 
</p>

<p><b>Windshield History and Thickness</b></p>
<p>
    For AT-802 aircraft beginning with serial number -0332, Air Tractor began installing thicker center plate windshields in production aircraft. 
    The new windshields are 3/8” (10665-2) thick as compared to the original 1/4" (10665-1) thick windshields. 
</p>
<p>
    For AT-802A aircraft, 1/4" thick PN 11248-1 windshields were installed until SN 0092.  Thicker (3/8") and somewhat wider 11833-1 windshields were installed in 
    SN 0093 and subsequent.
</p>
<p>
    In 2024, Air Tractor began installing Storm Shield windshields on all new production aircraft.
    AT-802's use the W-10665-2 windshield while AT-802A's use the W-11833-1.  These windshields provide
    enhanced impact resistance protection from bird strikes.
</p>
<p>
    All center windshields are safety plate windshield glass.  
<p>  
    If your aircraft is equipped with the original, thinner windshields, Air Tractor recommends that you retrofit the thicker windshields 
    (Air Tractor or Storm Shield) for increased impact resistance and durability.  
    The windshields install using the same brackets and hardware as the originals. 
</p>

<p>To remove any of the windshields, the following procedure may be followed: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Remove all of the #10 screws that secure the upper and lower retaining strips on the outside of the windshield.</li>
    <li>
        Remove all of the #10 screws in the retaining strips on the left-hand-and right-hand sides of the respective portion 
        of the windshield that is to be removed.  
    </li>
    <li>Remove the retaining strips and associated fasteners and fittings that surround the subject windshield panel.</li>
    <li>
        Gently pry the windshield free from the sealing strip beneath. Pry gently around the perimeter of the panel with a 
        putty knife or other suitable flexible, wide-blade tool.
    </li>
    <li>Lift the windshield panel free of the airplane.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The sealant may be removed from the edges of the panel and the windshield recess in the windshield frame by scraping gently with a dull blade. 
    The safety-glass center windshield may be cleaned with the use of acetone or methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK).
</p>

<div class="boxCautionSmall">
    <p class="boxCautionLargeHeader">CAUTION</p>
    <p class="boxCautionLargeText">The use of solvents on the plastic panels will distort the surfaces and render them unstable.</p>
</div>

<p>
    The windshield may be reinstalled by reversing the removal steps above. 
</p>

<p>
    The windshield is sealed around the upper and lower edge under the metal flanges with commercial grade putty. 
    Then the entire perimeter of the windshield is sealed with PR1422-A2 (See Section <xref sectionTarget="2.75.2" prependLabel="Section"></xref> 
    for mixing instructions). Drill .166 holes through the windshield to match the aluminum attachments. 
    Then remove the windshield and enlarge the holes in the windshield to 3/16" to prevent the attach screws from 
    over-stressing and cracking the windshield at any location.
</p>

<p>
    The best method to apply the sealant is to mask the retaining strips first and then mask the windshield 
    leaving 1/8" of windshield surface exposed between the tape and the retaining strip. 
    Apply the sealant sparingly to the exposed windshield surface, then remove masking tape. 
</p>

<p>
    The sealant starts to cure when catalyzed, so time is precious when applying sealant. 
    The sealant should be allowed a 24-hour cure before stressing.
</p>

<p>
    If you are replacing 1/4" thick windshields with 3/8" thick windshields (Air Tractor or Storm Shield), update the 
    airplane's weight and balance as follows:
</p>
<p class="tabOver">
    AT-802 weight change of +5.7 lb @ Station 64.3.
</p>
<p class="tabOver">
    AT-802A weight change of +3.7 lb @ Station 64.3
</p>
