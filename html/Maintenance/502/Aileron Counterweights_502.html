The lead counterweight will sometimes loosen on the long AN bolt running through the weight and support tube. If the counterweight is loose, the counterweight/support tube assembly should drilled and reamed for a larger bolt. To perform this process, the aileron must first be removed from the aircraft per 2.10.1. <span style="color: red;">Hyperlink here?</span>

The counterweight support tube can be removed from the aileron by removing the two plug buttons on the upper and lower side of the aileron nose skin and removing the AN bolt that attaches the support tube to the support structure that riveted to the aileron. The counterweight and support tube can be taken to the workbench and the long AN bolt removed. Leaving the parts assembled, clamp the counterweight to the base of the drill-press. Use a long 3/16" drill bit chucked in the drill press to align the spindle with the 3/16" hole which goes completely through the counterweight and support tube. Change to a 7/32" drill bit and drill through both parts to enlarge the existing 3/16" hole. Finally, use a .248" reamer to create the final and enlarged hole through both parts. Grease the new diameter AN bolt, install and torque.
<p>
Reinstall the counterweight and support tube assembly on the aileron and check for a snug fit. The AN3 bolts have a torque of 60 inch-pounds applied at the nut and the AN4 bolts have a torque of 100 inch-pounds applied at the nut. Reinstall the aileron per 2.10.1 <span style="color: red;">hyperlink here?</span>, taking care that the washer arrangement is correct. The bolt through the pushrod and wing bellcrank uses a AN bolt with a AN960 washer under the head and another one under the AN365 nut.
