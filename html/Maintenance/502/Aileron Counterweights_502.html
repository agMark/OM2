    The counterweight support tube is p/n 20279-1 and can be removed from the aileron by removing the two plug buttons
    on the upper and lower side of the aileron nose skin and removing the AN3-12A bolt that attaches the support tube to
    the support structure that is riveted to the aileron. The counterweight and support tube can be taken to the
    workbench where the long AN3-33A bolt is removed. Leaving the parts together, clamp the counterweight to the base of
    the drill-press, using a long 3/16" drill bit chucked in the drill press align the spindle with the 3/16 hole
    through the counterweight and support tube. Then change to a 7/32" drill bit and enlarge the hole. Then ream .248
    through both parts. Grease the new AN4-33A bolt and install. Re-install the counterweight and support tube on the
    aileron and check for a snug fit. The AN3 bolts have a torque of 60 inch-pounds applied at the nut, the AN4 bolts
    have a torque of 100 inch-pounds applied at the nut. Re-install the aileron in the reverse order as removed, taking
    care that the washer arrangement is correct. The bolt through the push rod and wing bellcrank is an AN4-12A with a
    AN960-416 washer under the head and one under the AN365-428A nut.
