    To rig the stabilizers, the elevators must be removed. The factory practice is to adjust the terminal in the forward
    strut so that approximately the same number of threads is showing on both R/H and L/H struts. The struts are pinned
    to the fuselage fittings and the stabilizers are pinned to the fuselage attach fittings (Don’t forget the washers
    under each bolt head) but no nuts yet. Have someone hold up the stabilizer tips when they are being attached. Then
    attach the struts to the forward eyebolts only. Sight down the stabilizer hinge line to see that the hinges on both
    sides of the aircraft line up within .03". Adjust each strut length the same amount until the hinges are in line.
    Then stand directly behind the aircraft on the exact fuselage centerline and raise or lower your line of sight until
    the same part of each stabilizer falls in the line of sight with a reference point on the wings. It is likely that
    the terminal on one strut will have to be lengthened a certain number of turns and the opposite strut shortened the
    same number of turns so that the stabilizers line up with the wings.

    Then adjust the terminal at the rear eyebolt on each side so that the bolts can be inserted without causing a twist
    in the stabilizers. All bolts are now in place, and it is necessary to re-check the hinge alignment from side to
    side and re-check the stabilizer position with the wings. If all is still in order, install the washers and nuts on
    all ten attach bolts (five each side). Torque the AN4 bolts to 100 inch-pounds on the nut and torque the AN6 bolts
    to 300 inch-pounds on the nut. Tighten the check nuts at the end of each terminal to 290 inch-pounds torque. Insert
    a piece of safety wire in the small inspection hole at each terminal location to be sure the terminal is screwed
    into the strut fitting far enough.

    Re-check nut installation on the stabilizer to frame location and install the gap covers with the 90008-1 screws. If
    the rubber channel is loose on the gap cover, re-attach with 3-M 8001 adhesive before the gap cover is installed.
