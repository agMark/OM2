Details of the bottom-load plumbing are shown below in Figure 2-36. The bottom load valve is manufactured by Transland and has shims that can be removed when wear develops. The aft half of the bottom loading plumbing attaches to the bottom loading valve with a hose and to the control valve with a hose and two clamps. The forward half of the bottom loading plumbing is a tube assembly.
