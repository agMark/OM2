<p style='color:black;'></p><b><u>Rigging Instructions:</u></b>

<p>Complete these instructions on both sides of the aircraft simultaneously.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit control lock. Confirm the ailerons are in the neutral position</li>

    <li>Check the position of the clamp that supports the two idler arms. This clamp should be 10.0 (+/-¼) inches from the interface of the longeron and diagonal tube. See <span style="color:red">Broken XREF link to an 802 figure.  This whole section needs redone for 502 I think.</span>. If necessary, loosen the clamp, adjust it within the slot to the correct position, and tighten it firmly. </li>

    <li>Adjust and install the dual cables. The cables should be spaced 0.75 (+/- 0.10) inches apart. Verify that the cable sheathing is not pinched and the cable ferrule is in firm contact with the connector. Tighten the cable connector lock nuts. </li>

    <li>While holding the clamp in position, perform the following aileron trim check:

         <ul>
            <li>
                <p style='color:red;'>What are the serial numbers, if any, for the 502/504 series?</p>For serial numbers XXXX: the cable should attach to the top hole in the inboard idler arm (approx. 3/8 from the end).
            </li>

         </ul>
     </li>

    <li><p style='color:black;'></p>Manually center the rudder and hold in place. </li>

    <li>Visually ensure that the rudder pedals are even in the cockpit. Adjust if needed. </li>

    <li>Measure the cable position to ensure that the mechanical advantage is correct. Measure from the center of the hole in the idler arm to the cable centerline (0.75 +/- 0.10 inches). </li>

    <li>If the cable position is not correct:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Loosen the cable connector lock nuts. </li>
            <li>Adjust the cable length by loosening or tightening the cable adjustment sleeve (threaded
                section). </li>
            <li>When the correct spacing is achieved, tighten the lock nuts firmly. </li>
            <li>Ensure that the cable connector ferrule is in firm contact with the connector. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Manually deflect the ailerons and rudder full travel (left and right) and confirm that no binding or
        rubbing occurs at any deflection. If binding is noted, troubleshoot and correct the problem. </li>

    <li>Interconnect system check:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Move the ailerons full deflection left, and confirm that the rudder also moves full left.</li>
            <li>Move the ailerons to full deflection right, and confirm that the rudder also moves full right.</li>
            <li>Move the ailerons to neutral, and confirm that the rudder also moves to neutral.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

</ol>

<p>Air Tractor has received a report of an in-flight jamming of a rudder pedal. The pilot was able to maintain control and, after landing, a cable pulley in the rudder system was found to be broken. Due to the numerous unsecured items in the baggage compartment, it is believed that one or more items fouled the cables causing the cables to jam resulting in a subsequent failure of the pulley. 
</p>
<p>Shield installations have been developed for serial numbers <p style='color:red;'>XXXX <p style='color:black;'></p>to prevent this from happening. To prevent possible baggage interference with the flight controls, we encourage the installation of these shields per the directions located in Service Letter #274.</p>
