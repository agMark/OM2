Flutter occurs when vibrations in an aircraft match the natural frequency of the structure. If not properly damped, the amplitude of oscillations can increase to a point where it leads to structural damage or failure. In order to avoid flutter in control surfaces, the following check for control surface unbalance has been developed.
<p>
When measuring unbalance, the control surfaces are painted completely with any applicable nav lights and tabs installed.
<p>
To measure the unbalance, the control surface is mounted horizontally on the hinge line as shown in the following figure. The trailing edge is supported with a scale and distance “x" measured. The unbalance is equal to “x" multiplied by the scale reading “W". This value must not exceed the maximum allowable unbalance limit as specified below.

<p>If the unbalance exceeds the limits above, you will likely need to strip and re-paint (especially if the surface has been painted multiple times) or check the counterweights.  Contact Air Tractor Customer Service for more information and assistance.</p>
