    The Pratt & Whitney PT6A series of engines have been proven to be one of the most reliable powerplants available
    today. The engine is a lightweight, reverse flow, free turbine engine utilizing two independent turbine sections.
    One section drives the compressor in the gas generator section and the second drives the propeller shaft through a
    gear reduction box.

    Air enters the engine through an annular plenum chamber, passing through a three-stage axial and one stage
    centrifugal compressor. In the combustion chamber, fuel mixed with air is ignited. The expanding gases are directed
    through the two turbines and out the exhaust ports on opposing sides of the engine.

    While an unfamiliar and complex looking piece of equipment, the engine is easy to understand and, with a little
    time, will begin to talk to you like all the others before.

    Maintenance on your Pratt & Whitney PT6A engine will be one of a preventative nature. Time and experience have
    proven that an engine properly maintained will give excellent service with a minimum of down time and expense.
    Establish a routine maintenance schedule and adhere to it as closely as possible, taking into consideration the
    problems of busy schedules in mid-season.
</p>

<p>
    Equally important to proper maintenance is the keeping of records. Maintenance records on a turbine engine are
    extremely important and every effort should be made to see that all the work performed is properly recorded. A
    record of the number of starts and flights MUST be kept for figuring cycle counts on the rotor components in your
    engine at each annual. The cycles are figured using the number of starts and flights, with a formula found in the
    applicable engine Service Bulletin. When these parts reach their life limit in either hours consumed or cycles, they
    must be removed and discarded. Few of you will ever see a part reach that limit but the records must be kept for
    your logbooks to be in proper order.
</p>

<p>
    While on the subject of record keeping, it is a good idea to keep a small pad in the cockpit to record engine
    parameters on a regular basis. For example, on the return from your first load each day, at the same altitude and
    with the same torque and propeller RPM setting, record the following: hour meter time, OAT, ITT, Ng, oil pressure,
    and fuel pressure. When trouble appears, this information will save lots of time troubleshooting and will also give
    you a good picture of the trends in your engine. Remember, no two engines will run the same. The change in your
    engine parameters over a period of time is what really matters. Keep it written down because your mind will deceive
    you over the span of a season and it is the best way for maintenance personnel to make an accurate diagnosis when
    problems arise.
</p>

<p>
    Troubleshooting on the PT6A engine is not that difficult, once you get acquainted with the engine. The most
    important thing you can do as an operator is keep an accurate record of the engine parameters. All troubleshooting
    starts with the information you will have on that little tablet. Maintenance personnel will need to know in what way
    the engine parameters have changed. As you become more experienced with the PT6A engine, all these parameters will
    come to have more meaning. Until all these things begin to come together, consult qualified personnel.

    If your aircraft is equipped with a PT6A-45R engine, it has been brought to our attention that there has been at
    least one case of a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-45R burner can that had vibrated loose and damaged an igniter plug and a
    nozzle sheath. This damage was discovered during a hot section inspection. Our Pratt & Whitney Service
    Representative advised us that they had seen this type of damage before. He indicated that the damage has primarily
    been discovered in high time engines that have had numerous visits to service shops. He believes that this type of
    failure is caused by imbalance in the power section, the gas generator section, or an out of balance propeller. He
    also pointed out that excessively worn or imbalanced gears in the propeller gear box or in the accessory gear box
    could cause vibrations and this type of damage.
</p>

<p>
    In light of this report we recommend that you remove your igniter plugs and nozzles and inspect them for damage. If
    damage is found to any of these components a complete hot section inspection should be performed, in accordance with
    Pratt & Whitney Maintenance Manual, and any required repairs be accomplished. More information may be found in
    Service Letter #126A.

<p>
    The Pratt & Whitney manuals are the current and best information by which owner should ensure that their engines are
    maintained with. These manuals supersede anything that has been published by Air Tractor as it pertains to
    maintaining Pratt & Whitney PT6A engines.
