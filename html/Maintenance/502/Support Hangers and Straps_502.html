The safety strap is designed to keep high pump pressure from blowing plumbing connections apart.
<p>
We have received several reports of the spray plumbing from the pump to the on-off valve blowing off the
pump after the stainless safety wire fails that is designed to prevent such occurrences. It has also been brought to our attention that the plumbing is susceptible to blowing off at the spray valve as well as at the pump. Since this results in loss of the chemical load, the factory recommends that owners check to see that the hose clamps are tight and double up the safety wire which connects the plumbing to the pump. Owners operating
AT-502/AT-502A aircraft thru s/n 502-0196 are referred to Service Letter #109 and Service Letter #114 for additional information.
