    We have received several reports of the spray plumbing from the pump to the on-off valve blowing off the
    pump after failing the stainless safety wire that helps prevent this from happening. It has also been brought to our
    attention that the plumbing is susceptible to blowing off at the spray valve as well as at the pump. Since this
    results in loss of the chemical load the factory recommends that owners immediately check to see that the hose
    clamps are tight and to double up on the safety wire that connects the plumbing to the pump. Owners operating
    AT-501/502/502A/503A thru s/n 502-0196 are referred to Service Letter #109 and Service Letter #114 and advised to
    contact your dealer for a strap that offers a surer method of preventing this occurrence.
