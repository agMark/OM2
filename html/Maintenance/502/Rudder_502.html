    The rudder is attached to the vertical fin with three AN4-10A bolts, with a AN960-416 washer under the bolt head,
    and two washers under the AN365-428A nut. The rudder hinges have NMB p/n ABT4 bearings installed, which are staked
    on each side of the 1/4" thick hinge fitting. Since there is a certain amount of drag with these spherical bearings,
    it is very important to fully torque (100 inch-pounds at the nut) the three AN4- 10A bolts that attach the rudder to
    the fin. If the bolts are loose, the bolts will turn on the fin hinge brackets and cause the holes to become
    elongated.

    The bearings have little wear, but if it is necessary to replace them, construct a “puller” that will apply force to
    the outer ring of the bearing with the opposing force against the aluminum housing. A AN4 bolt through both parts of
    the “puller” should be tightened until the bearing rim is pulled past the stake marks and the bearing comes out of
    the housing. When the new bearing is installed, re-stake with a center punch.

    The rudder horn is p/n 70092-1 and has two p/n 70093-1 bushings installed for wear at the cable attachment. The horn
    is attached to the rudder assembly with two AN4C7A bolts.

    Rudder control stops are at the rudder horn and the rudder travel is 21˚ Left, 21˚ Right, +/-1˚.

    Aircraft s/n 501-0002 & subsequent and s/n 502-0003 thru 502B-0595 may have experienced wear at the aft rudder
    fairlead. To solve this problem and extend the life of the cables Air Tractor has changed the design of the cable.
    The new cables incorporate a stainless sleeve that is crimped to the cable in this area. The sleeve of the new cable
    rides in the fairlead and prevents the cable strands from wearing. For more information about installing upgraded
    parts, refer to Service Letter #190.

    It is recommended that Part #71164-1 cable guard be installed on all aircraft. Aircraft damage due to a loose rudder
    cable may occur due to the loss of the cable attaching hardware--erosion of the cotter pin from fertilizer blasting
    may allow a complete loss of the attaching bolt and nut. Air Tractor has developed a stainless-steel guard to the
    rudder cable attach hardware to prevent such a recurrence.
