The airplane is leveled to "level flight attitude" by jacking the tailwheel. Refer to Section 2.0.4 <span style="color: red;">(is this a good place for a hyperlink?)</span> for proper jacking procedures. The airplane should be in this level position for aircraft weighing and other maintenance/ installation items that require the aircraft to be in level flight attitude. The airplane is in level flight attitude when the top (right next to the side of the fuselage) of the L/H landing gear leg is at an angle of 5 degrees (tail down) from level. To measure this angle, use an electronic level placed atop the main gear leg.
<p>
Alternately, the airplane may be leveled with an accurate bubble level and a wedge. The wedge may be fabricated of wood with an included angle of five degrees (1:11.43). The wedge should be placed on the flat part of the landing gear leg next to the fuselage with the sharp end of the wedge pointing toward the front of the airplane. A bubble level placed on top of the wedge will indicate level when the aircraft is level.
<p>
On aircraft equipped with the aluminum engine air scoop on the bottom of the cowling (non-ram air induction system), there are two small screws provided on the left hand side of the engine air scoop that provide a level reference. When a bubble level is aligned with the heads of these screws, the bubble level will indicate level when the aircraft is level.
