    The elevator trim tabs are p/n 30055-1 L/H, 30055-2 R/H and attach to the elevators with 90015-5 screws (Machine
    screws, stainless, truss head, Phillips, 1032 x 1/2" long). There are NAS680A3 anchor nuts installed on the
    elevators for these screws.

    A p/n 70646-1 push-rod attaches to the trim tab horn with an AN3-7A bolt and to the idler arm in the stabilizer with
    AN3-6 bolts, AN310-3 nuts, An960-10 washers, MS24665-151 cotters. Be sure the push-rod is positioned with the bend
    on the fwd end approximately under the elevator spar tube. There is a Bunting P19- 1 bushing at each joint, which
    should be replaced if the tab free play at the trailing edge exceeds .20 inches. If there is still excessive free
    play check the bolts for wear and check the push-rod ends for wear. Install new push-rods if the holes are worn.

    Keep the trim tab piano hinge and joints well lubricated with general purpose oil.
