    To help protect against damage from strong or gusty winds when parked, your Air Tractor airplane should be tied down
    to ground tie-down facilities using lines made of nylon rope, vinyl-covered chain or cable, or nylon webbing. The
    lines should have a tensile strength of more than 3,000 lbs.

<p>
    The airplane should be parked with the nose pointed into the anticipated wind, if possible. The parking brake should
    be set and the main landing gear tires should be chocked front and rear.

    <p class="boxCautionLargeText">
        Do not set the parking brake when the brakes are overheated or during cold weather when accumulated moisture may
        freeze the brakes. The main wheels should always be chocked when parked, but this is especially important if the
        parking brake is not set.

    Install the control stick lock and rudder lock and set all trim tabs to neutral position. If available, install a
    pitot tube cover, engine inlet cover, engine exhaust covers (when cool), and install the propeller tether.

<p>
    Secure the wings to the ground anchors using the wing tie-down rings located beneath the front spars of each wing,
    and secure to the ground anchors. These lines should be oriented as close to vertical as possible (within 30 degrees
    of vertical). The tail wheel is secured by wrapping and tying the tie-down line around the tailwheel spring. This
    line should be tied to a ground anchor located slightly aft of the tail wheel. Use care to avoid damaging the tail
    wheel lock mechanism.
</p>

<p>
    If winds in excess of 20 mph from the rear of the aircraft are expected or possible, suitable blocks should be used
    to lock the control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, and rudder) in place and relieve strain on the control systems.
    Very large damaging dynamic loads are possible with a gusty reverse flow of air over the control surfaces. Should
    this happen without blocks in place, be sure to check all push-rods and rod-ends in the aileron control system for
    damage before flight.
</p>

<p>
    When leaving your airplane outside, be sure and cover the exhaust ports and keep the propeller tethered. The
    propeller needs to be tethered to prevent the windmilling of the power section. The reason for this is that the oil
    pump is in the rear of the engine and will not turn with the prop and therefore, will not provide oil to the front
    of the engine. Don't be too embarrassed the first time you start the engine with the propeller tethered, I can
    assure you that you are not the first.
</p>

<p>
    Aircraft should be tied down at the conclusion of each flight to prevent damage incurred by wind. The aircraft
    should be positioned facing into the wind or as nearly as possible, depending upon the available parking position.
    Park the aircraft with clearance from the nearest aircraft greater than or equal to the length of the major axis
    (wingspan or fuselage length) of the largest aircraft in local operation plus ten feet. Once positioned properly,
    the tail wheel should be locked in the fore-and-aft position. Refer to <xref sectionTarget="2.200"
        prependLabel="Section"></xref> for
    replacement of the tie-down ring.
