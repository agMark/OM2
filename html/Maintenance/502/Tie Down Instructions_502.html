To help protect against damage from strong or gusty winds when parked, your Air Tractor airplane should be tied down to ground tie-down facilities using lines made of nylon rope, vinyl-covered chain or cable, or nylon webbing. The lines should have a tensile strength of more than 3,000 lbs.

The airplane should be parked with the nose pointed into the anticipated wind, if possible. The parking brake should be set, and the main landing gear tires should be chocked front and rear.

Do not set the parking brake when the brakes are 
overheated or during cold weather when accumulated moisture may freeze the brakes. The main wheels should always be chocked when parked, but this is especially important if the parking brake is not set.

Install the control stick lock and rudder lock and set all trim tabs to neutral position. If available, install a pitot tube cover, engine inlet cover, engine exhaust covers (when cool), and install the propeller tether.

Secure the wings to the ground anchors using the wing tie-down rings located beneath the front spars of each wing, and secure to the ground anchors. These lines should be oriented as close to vertical as possible (within 30 degrees of vertical). The tail wheel is secured by wrapping and tying the tie-down line around the tail wheel spring. This line should be tied to a ground anchor located slightly aft of the tail wheel. Use care to avoid damaging the tail wheel lock mechanism.

If winds in excess of 20 mph from the rear of the aircraft are expected or possible, suitable control surface gust locks should be used to lock the control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, and rudder) in place and relieve strain on the control systems. Very large damaging dynamic loads are possible with a gusty reverse flow of air over the control surfaces. Should this happen without control surface gust locks in place, be sure to check all pushrods and rod-ends in the aileron control system for damage before flight.
