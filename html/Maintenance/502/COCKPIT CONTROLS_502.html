    The control stick assembly (p/n 70346-1 for the AT-502A/502B, 2 each of p/n 70346-16 for the AT- 504) is attached to the torque tube assembly (p/n 70050-7 for the AT-502A/502B, 2 each of p/n 71953-1 for the AT-504) with an NAS1304-44 bolt. The lower end of the control stick is a machined aluminum part (p/n 70043-1) which houses two Fafnir KP4 bearings held in place by two p/n 1300-93 snap rings. The control stick weld assembly (p/n 70047-1 for the AT502A/502B and 2 each of p/n 71704-1) is chrome plated and oiled internally. The control stick grip is an Automatic Flagman p/n NA1-135.

    On the AT-502A/502B, a p/n 70294-2 pushrod connects the control stick to the forward idler assembly with an AN4-13A bolt in each end. The pushrod has Fafnir RE4H6 bearings in each end attached with 98296A999 roll pins. If new bearings are ordered, be sure to specify that they are to be drilled for installation.

    On the AT-504, a p/n 71952-2 pushrod connects each control stick to a torque tube (p/n 71720-3) with an AN4-13A bolt in each end. The torque tube is mounted in PB 1/2 bearings on either end with AN6- 21A bolts mounting the bearings to the fuselage frame. Another pushrod (p/n 71952-1) connects this torque tube to the forward idler assembly with an AN4-13A bolt in each end. These pushrods have Fafnir RE4H6 bearings in one end attached with 98296A999 roll pins, and Fafnir RE4M6 bearings threaded into the opposite end. If new RE4H6 bearings are ordered, be sure to specify that they are to be drilled for installation.

    The torque tube assembly (p/n 70050-7 for the AT-502A/502B, 2 each of p/n 71953-1 for the AT- 504) to which the control stick fastens is supported on each end with a p/n 70160-1 housing assembly which attaches to the fuselage frame with AN5-14A bolts (and 71996-X shims on the AT-504). Each housing assembly has a grease fitting installed and grease should be applied at least during annual inspections. The bronze bushings in the housing are Bunting ER1416-16 which may be replaced if required. The bushing is a flange type and after a period of time bushing wear will cause fore and aft slack in the torque tube as the elevators are moved up and down with the control stick. The slack may be removed by adding a .010 thick shim (p/n 3088A) which is 7/8 I.D. x 1 3/8 O.D. With the torque tube all the way against the rear flange, clearance on the front flange should be between .001 and .005. If the shim is a little too thick, the face of the forward flange can be faced off slightly if desired.

    On the AT-502A/502B, the forward end of the torque tube has a p/n 70149-1 boot and 70144-1 boot ring installed, with 90008-1 screws attaching the boot ring to the floor. On the aft cockpit wall, a p/n 70148-1 boot and 70142-1 boot ring seal the forward elevator pushrod entrance. The hopper handle has a p/n 80168-1 boot with a p/n 70140-2 boot ring, and the spray lever pushrod has a p/n 80131-1 boot with p/n 70154-1 boot ring. The trim pushrod has a p/n 70070-1 boot and a p/n 70143-1 boot ring.

On the AT-504, just aft of the control stick, the torque tube has a p/n 70149-1 boot and 70144-1 boot ring installed, with 90008-1 screws attaching the boot ring to the floor. On the aft cockpit wall, 6 each p/n 71759-1 boots and 2 each 71965-1 boot rings seal the forward elevator pushrod and rudder pushrod entrances. The hopper handle has a p/n 80168-1 boot with a p/n 70140-2 boot ring, and the spray lever pushrod has a p/n 80131-1 boot with p/n 70154-1 boot ring. The trim pushrod has a p/n 70070-1 boot and a p/n 70143-1 boot ring.

    A control lock assembly (p/n 70748-1 for the AT-502A/502B and p/n 71982-1 for the AT-504) is attached to two AN42B-4A eyebolts that are part of the instrument panel attachment. An Ajax No. 38 Spring keeps the control lock pulled up out of the way.
