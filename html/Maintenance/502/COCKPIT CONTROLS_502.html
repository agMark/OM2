The control stick assembly is p/n 70698-1 for the 802A (p/n 70049-9 for the 802-2 seat version) and is attached to the 70730-1 torque tube assembly with a NAS1304-44 bolt. The lower end of the control stick is a machined aluminum part (p/n 70043-1) which houses two Fafnir KP4 bearings held in place by two p/n 1300-93 snap rings. The control stick weld assembly is p/n 70037-1 and is chrome-plated and oiled internally. The control stick grip is an Automatic Flagman p/n NA1-135.

A p/n 70726-1 push-rod connects the control stick to the forward idler assembly with an AN4-13A bolt in each end. The push-rod has Fafnir REP4M6 bearings in each end, which allows length adjustment.
<p>
The 70730-1 (802A) or 70507-1 (802) torque tube is supported on each end with a p/n 70721-1 housing assembly, which attaches to the fuselage fame with AN5-14A bolts. Each housing assembly has grease fitting installed, and the grease should be applied at least during 12-month inspections. The needle bearings in the housings are Torrington B1212, which may be replaced if required. The flange thrust surface, after a period of time, will wear causing fore- and aft slack in the torque tube as the elevators are moved up and down with the control stick. The slack may be removed by adding a .010 thick shim (p/n 3088A324) which is 3/4 I.D. x 1 1/8 O.D. With the torque tube all the way against the rear flange, clearance on the front flange should be between .001 and .005. If the shim is a little too thick, the face of the forward flange can be faced off slightly if desired.
<p>
The forward end of the torque tube has a p/n 70149-2 boot and a 70144-1 boot ring installed, with 9008-1 screws attaching the boot ring to the floor. On the aft cockpit wall, a p/n 70543-1 boot and 70542-1 ring seal the forward elevator push-rod entrance. The hopper handle has a p/n 80168-1 boot with a p/n 80168-1 boot with a p/n 70140-1 boot ring, and the spray lever push-rod has a p/n 80131-1 boot with p/n 70154-1 boot ring. The trim push-rod has a p/n 70817-1 boot and a p/n 70818-1 boot ring.
<p>
A p/n 70478-1 control lock assembly is attached to two AN42B-4A eyebolts that are part of the instrument panel attachment. An Ajax No. 38 Spring keeps the control lock pulled up out of the way.

(are all of these p/n correct for the 502/504 series?)
