The control stick assembly is attached to the torque tube assembly with a NAS bolt. The lower end of the control stick is a machined aluminum part which houses two Fafnir bearings held in place by two snap rings. The control stick weld assembly is chrome-plated and oiled internally. The control stick grip is manufactured by Automatic Flagman.

A push-rod connects the control stick to the forward idler assembly with an AN bolt in each end. The push-rod has Fafnir bearings in each end, which allows length adjustment.

The torque tube is supported on each end by a housing assembly, which attaches to the fuselage fame with AN bolts. Each housing assembly has grease fitting installed, and the grease should be applied during 12-month inspections at a minimum. The needle bearings in the housings may be replaced if required. After a period of time, the flange thrust surface will wear, causing fore- and aft slack in the torque tube as the elevators are moved up and down with the control stick. The slack may be removed by adding a .010 thick shim which have 3/4 I.D. x 1 1/8 O.D. dimensions. With the torque tube all the way against the rear flange, clearance on the front flange should be between .001 and .005. If the shim is a little too thick, the face of the forward flange can be faced off slightly.
<p>
The forward end of the torque tube has a boot and a boot ring installed, with screws attaching the boot ring to the floor. On the aft cockpit wall, a boot and ring seal the forward elevator push-rod entrance. The hopper handle, spray handle and trim pushrod all have boots and boot rings.

A control lock assembly is attached to two AN eyebolts that are part of the instrument panel attachment. An Ajax #38 spring keeps the control lock pulled up out of the way when not in use.
