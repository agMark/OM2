The spray pump is manufactured by Agrinautics and is attached to an Agrinautics strut assembly with AN bolts.

The standard fan is a Micronair product and is intended for moderate spray volume use. Other units that are approved for use are the Arrowprop four blade wood and  Weath-Aero fans. The AT-504 uses a Micronair or Weath-Aero fan.

For high volume dispersal, install an additional 40 nozzles to the spray booms and change to larger spray tips on the spray nozzles. Figure 2-34 below shows typical spray configurations. The figure also shows the orifice sizes and flow rates of the various tips at common spray pressures.

Air Tractor supplies the aircraft with Spraying Systems QU-4010 spray tips pointed 10° down from straight back. These fan tips (with a 40° fan spray angle) pointed 10° down provide excellent deposition with minimal drift.

Additional information on recommended spray pressures and droplet size is available from the factory.
