    All Air Tractor aircraft use a gas-cycle air conditioning system for climate control. The air conditioning system
    lets the pilot select ram air from outside, re-circulate cockpit air, or a mix of the two. The ram-air control
    handle location is on the aft-cockpit wall on the RH side of the pilot.
</p>

    The 53126-X compressor has five reciprocating pistons driven by a rotating wobble-plate. It uses reed-type valves to
    control flow at the suction and pressure ports. Mechanical power to drive the compressor comes from an engine
    accessory drive pad. Gears in the engine drive are a splined-quill shaft that turns a small poly “V” groove pulley
    that drives the flywheel pulley with a serpentine belt. The flywheel pulley is connected to the compressor shaft by
    an electromagnetic clutch.
</p>

<p>
    The 53126-X compressor is factory-charged to the correct level with Sanden SP-15 oil. The initial oil charge is 210
    cc. It is not necessary to check the compressor's oil level as routine maintenance. The oil level must be checked
    when a system component has been replaced or if you think there is an oil leak. All refrigerant must be removed from
    the system (depressurized) before the oil is checked.
</p>

<p>
    The air conditioner fans, blowers, and compressor clutch are powered by the aircraft bus. All control switches for
    the air conditioning system are located on the Instrument Panel. The pilot can use the switches to turn the system
    on or off and to control the cockpit-blower speed as HIGH, MED, or LOW.
</p>

<p>
    Compressor clutches and compressor-clutch magnets are no longer available from the manufacturer for the original
    R-12 air conditioner system. Since there are still many of these units in service, Air Tractor has an alternate
    clutch available. The original R-12 clutch is easily identified by the double "V" belt pulley grooves.
</p>

<p>
    If your compressor clutch requires servicing, we suggest that you convert the system to R-134a refrigerant according
    to Service Letter #159. However, if you wish to continue to use R-12 refrigerant, the clutch may be replaced with
    the P/N 25-8502-24 poly-V belt clutch. To install the P/N 25-8502-24 clutch on your aircraft, refer to Service
    Letter #181. (Operators currently using the R-12 air conditioning system wishing to convert to the R-134a system
    should refer to Service Letter #159.)
</p>

<p>
    A Freon Recycling Unit (FRU) that reclaims the R-134a refrigerant is recommended when refrigerant is added or
    removed.
</p>

<p>
    Servicing procedures for the air conditioner are generally the same as those for comparable automotive units. Most
    servicing is accomplished by adding or removing Refrigerant R-134a at the servicing ports. These ports are located
    beneath the upper right-hand side skin immediately aft of the cockpit.

    Air Tractor has developed a new drive shaft for the 51628 drive pad assembly. This new drive shaft (PN 51198-1)
    features an integral pulley. This new drive shaft is assembled into the 51648-1 housing and interfaces to the engine
    identically to the existing drive shaft assembly. For further information, refer to Service Letter #369.
</p>

<p>
    Air Tractor has received a report of an air conditioner blower motor that burned up. As the varnish type insulation
    of the motor coils decomposed, smoke was emitted into the cockpit. This caused the pilot discomfort and reduced his
    visibility.
</p>

<p>
    For those operators which have a Collins wind-driven air conditioner, we have become aware of several instances
    where during installation of the air conditioner compressor holes have inadvertently been drilled in the lower spar
    cap of the wing. This is a very dangerous situation because nicks or holes in the lower spar cap often become the
    starting point of cracks. If this situation is present, more information can be found in Service Letter #115.
</p>

<p>
    On all except the very early Air Tractor air conditioners, the blower motor is cooled by air from the blower
    housing. There is a tube, p/n 60840-1, connecting the housing to the motor-case vent. The smoke entered the cockpit
    through the vent tube. To prevent smoke from entering the cockpit in the event of a motor burn out, the tube should
    be removed. To remove the tube, follow the instructions in Service Letter #179.
