All Air Tractor aircraft use a gas-cycle air conditioning system for climate control. The air conditioning system lets the pilot select ram air from outside, re-circulate cockpit air, or a mix of the two. The ram-air control handle location is on the aft-cockpit wall on the RH side of the pilot.

The 53126-X compressor has five reciprocating pistons driven by a rotating wobble-plate. It uses reed-type valves to control flow at the suction and pressure ports. Mechanical power to drive the compressor comes from an engine accessory drive pad. Gears in the engine drive are a splined-quill shaft that turns a small poly “V" groove pulley that drives the flywheel pulley with a serpentine belt. The flywheel pulley is connected to the compressor shaft by an electromagnetic clutch.

The 53126-X compressor is factory-charged to the correct level with Sanden SP-15 oil. The initial oil charge is 210 cc. It is not necessary to check the compressor's oil level as routine maintenance. The oil level must be checked when a system component has been replaced or if you think there is an oil leak. All refrigerant must be removed from the system (depressurized) before the oil is checked.

The air conditioner fans, blowers, and compressor clutch are powered by the aircraft bus. All control switches for the air conditioning system are located on the Instrument Panel. The pilot can use the switches to turn the system on or off and to control the cockpit-blower speed as HIGH, MED, or LOW.

A Freon Recycling Unit (FRU) that reclaims the R-134a refrigerant is recommended when refrigerant is added or removed.
<p>
Servicing procedures for the air conditioner are generally the same as those for comparable automotive units. Most servicing is accomplished by adding or removing Refrigerant R-134a at the servicing ports. These ports are located beneath the upper right-hand side skin immediately aft of the cockpit.

The low pressure port has a blue cap, and the high pressure port has a red cap.
