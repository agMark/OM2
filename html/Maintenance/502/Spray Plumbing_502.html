Details of the spray plumbing are shown below in Figure 2-35.

The plumbing from the hopper gate box to the spray pump consists of a tube assembly with a coupler attached to the gate box and a hose attached to the tube. The hose is secured with clamps which are constructed entirely of stainless steel.
<p>
The plumbing from the discharge side of the pump to the valve has a coupler at the valve end with hoses which are double clamped. In addition, a strap is used at the pump to safety the clamp to the top of the pump quick-coupler, preventing the tube from blowing off due to excessive pressure or water hammer effects.
<p>
The tube attaches to a strainer and boom “Tee” assembly. Standard spray booms will fit on either side. 
<p>
The boom “Tee” assembly is supported with straps on the support assemblies and are attached with stainless steel AN4 bolts. Faspins are used to attach the support assemblies to the fuselage frame.
<p>
In some operations, high-volume spray work and/or rapid spray valve operation can cause hydraulic shock in the spray system. This shock, otherwise known as “water hammer”, may cause a pressure spike that can damage the pressure sensor. A small and inexpensive orifice can be installed to help isolate the pressure sensor from this pressure spike and prevent sensor damage. This orifice may be retrofitted to an aircraft using the instructions found in Service Letter #308.
