    The plumbing from the hopper gate box to the spray pump consists of a p/n 80385-1 tube assembly with a p/n 22899
    coupler attached to the gate box and a 80376-1 hose attached to the 80385-1 tube. The hose is clamped with 200-56S
    clamps which are entirely stainless.

<p>
    The plumbing from the discharge side of the pump to the valve is p/n 80177-1 and has a 80743-1 coupler at the valve
    end. The hoses are p/n 80045-1 and are double clamped with QS200M36S clamps. In addition, at the pump an 81069-1
    strap is used to safety the clamp to the top of the pump quick coupler (p/n 42320) to prevent the 80177-1 tube from
    blowing off due to high pressure and water hammer effects.

    The tube attaching to the strainer is p/n 80765-1 and the boom “Tee” assembly is p/n 80392-12. Standard spray booms
    are p/n 80307-1 and will fit on either side. Micronair booms are p/n 80333-1 (L/H) and 80333-2 (R/H).

<p>
    The boom “Tee” assembly is supported on the L/H side with a p/n 80400-4 assembly and on the R/H side with a p/n
    80386-4 assembly. The straps on the support assemblies are p/n 80383-1 and are attached with AN4C6A bolts.
    D4-10T-303 Faspins are used to attach the support assemblies to the fuselage frame.

    For aircraft that has the digital hopper quantity display (manufactured by Amtech Manufacturing, Inc.) installed:
    In some operations, high-volume spray work and/or rapid spray valve operation can cause hydraulic shock in the spray
    system. This shock, otherwise known as “water hammer,” can cause a pressure spike that can damage the pressure
    sensor. A small, inexpensive orifice can be installed to help isolate the pressure sensor from this pressure spike
    and prevent the sensor from being damaged. This orifice may be retrofitted to your aircraft using the instructions
    found in Service Letter #308.
