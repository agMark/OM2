Details of the elevator trim tab controls are shown in Figure 2-20. The elevator trim tab system uses the elevator tabs as both trim tabs and as elevator boost tabs. The boost tabs function to relieve a portion of the control load during maneuvers.

Elevator trim is controlled by a handwheel on the left-hand wall of the cockpit. The handwheel is shaft-connected to a two-sheave drum that drives two taut and opposing cables. These are connected at their opposite end to a pulley shaft that positions a worm gear in a gear box that is located in the aft fuselage. The worm-gear box is shown below in Figure 2-21.

<p>
The worm gear drives a sector gear with an exposed sector arm attached on the aft side of the gatebox. The sector arm is connected by a pushrod to a bellcrank that transmits the motion to an idler just forward of the aft edge of the horizontal stabilizer. One of these idlers is shown below in Figure 2-22.

<p>

A bellcrank is attached to the fuselage frame with AN bolts, Bunting bushings, spacer bushings and AN nuts and washers under the nuts. The bellcrank should be removed during 12-month inspections and the bushings inspected for wear and lubricated.
<p>
The pushrods from the trim bellcrank to the idler arm on the stabilizer rear spar are adjustable. The ends are AN clevis ends with AN check nuts. Attachments are with AN bolts, nuts and washers and Mil Spec cotter pins. The long pushrod going forward from the bellcrank has a Fafnir bearing attached to the bellcrank with a AN bolt, washers and a nut.
<p>
Fairleads have snap rings and the forward end going into the cockpit connects to the top hole in the trim lever with the same hardware as connecting to the trim bellcrank.
<p>
Two pushrods attach to the trim tab horn with AN bolts and nuts and attaches to the idler arm in the stabilizer with AN bolts, nuts, washers and Mil Spec cotter pins. Be sure the pushrod is positioned with the bend on the forward end approximately under the elevator spar tube. There is a Bunting bushing at the forward joint which should be replaced if the tab free play is excessive. If excessive free play still exists, check the bolts and pushrod ends for wear. Install new pushdrods if the holes are worn.

<b>Maximum Tab Free Play</b>
<p>
In order to avoid the possibility of control surface flutter, the tab must not have excessive free play.
<p>
Maximum free play for the AT-<span style="color: red;">XXX</span> elevator trim tab  (which includes all bearing free play in the control system) is <span style="color: red;">XXX</span> in. To determine free play, use a dial indicator to measure the movement of the trim tab trailing edge.
