    The trim lever is p/n p/n 71362-2 for AT-502A/502B or p/n 71362-4 for AT-504. It has a p/n 70453-1 stop installed with slotted holes that allow movement up and down to adjust the tab travel. To position the lever in neutral, install the control lock, position the lever in the green band, and adjust the forward push-rod until the trim tabs are lined up with the elevator trailing edge. The stop can then be moved up or down to provide a tab travel of 9˚ up, 7˚ down +/-1 1/2˚.

    If the trim lever creeps in flight, adjust the stops on each side of the trim lever so that a gap of .020" is provided on each side of the lever.
