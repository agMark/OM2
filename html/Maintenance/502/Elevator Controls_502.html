    The aft elevator push-rod that connects to the elevator horns is p/n 70020-1 (AT-502A/502B) or 71783- 7 (504) and is
    adjustable on the forward end which has a Fafnir RE4M6 bearing installed. The aft end of the push-rod has a NMB p/n
    ABT4 bearing same as the elevators and rudder and is pressed into place and staked same as in other applications. If
    it is to be removed, see the “Rudder” section for removal instructions.

    The aft elevator idler is p/n 70023-1 and attaches to the fuselage frame with a AN4-20A bolt. This idler has two
    Torrington B 610 bearings installed, with a p/n 70055-1 spacer bushing and two AN960-416 washers on each end to
    contain the Torrington bearings. During annual inspections, this idler should be removed, and the bearings cleaned
    and packed with general purpose grease. Check for excessive wobble on the lower end of the idler which would
    indicate worn bearings, or a worn spacer, or both. When the idler is re-installed be sure to grease the bolt before
    installation and torque to 100 inch-pounds at the nut. After installation, check the aft push rod to see that it
    will rotate slightly in either direction to indicate that the RE4M6 bearing is positioned properly, and check the
    AN316-6 check nut at the bearing for snug.

    Also remove the control lock and push the elevator through the full range of travel, checking the clearance of the
    bolt through the elevator horns with the fuselage structure. Since two washers are installed on this bolt, one may
    be under the bolt head, or both may be under the nut, depending upon which arrangement gives the best clearance to
    the fuselage structure.

    Check the position of the eyebolt in the aft idler that the tail wheel lock spring is attached to. The spring is
    International Harvester p/n 54548-D and if the eyebolt is positioned correctly, the spring end will slide easily
    through the eyebolt as the elevator is moved from full down to full up. A little grease at this point will help.

    The tail lock cable is p/n 71144-1 and attaches to an AN115-21 shackle and MS20392-2-21 clevis pin at the lock pin
    lifting arms (p/n 40019-1) at the tail gear. At the forward end, the cable attaches to a p/n 71173-1 rod assembly
    using an AN3C6 bolt, AN960C10 washer, AN310C3 nut, and MS24665-151 cotter. The rod assembly is supported by 40701-00
    guides at the tail spring clamp and the fuselage frame. The forward end of the rod assembly attaches to a p/n
    71158-1 cable assembly using a MS21251-B5S barrel and AN316-4 nut. The forward end of the cable assembly attaches to
    the 54548-D spring mentioned above. Check for wear at the fairleads, and for general cable condition.

    A large aluminum push-rod (p/n 70011-9 for AT-502A/502B; p/n 71951-1 for AT-504) connects the aft elevator idler to
    the forward idler (p/n 70117-1). The aluminum push-rod is attached to the lower end of the aft idler with a
    AN43B-15A eyebolt with 4 each AN960-416 washers under the head and 4 washers under the nut. It attaches to the upper
    end of the forward idler with a AN4-13A bolt. The push-rod has a Fafnir RE4S10 bearing installed with 98296A999
    rollpins in each end. In case the bearings wear out they can be replaced but be sure to order them drilled for
    assembly. If the aircraft is parked outside in a moderate wind with the side skins removed, the aluminum push-rod
    will vibrate excessively, so it is a good idea to have only one side skin removed at a time if working outside in
    the wind.

    The forward idler is attached to the fuselage frame with an AN4-50A bolt. Fafnir KP6A bearings are installed in each
    end and a stainless spacer bushing (p/n 70081-1) allows the bolt to be fully torqued (100 inch-pounds at the nut).
    The forward idler will have end play but up to .040 is acceptable.
