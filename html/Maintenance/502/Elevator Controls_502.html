Details of the elevator controls are shown below in Figure 2-18. The aft elevator pushrod connects to the elevator horns and is adjustable on the forward end (which has a Fafnir bearing installed). The aft end of the pushrod has an NMB bearing staked and pressed into place identically to those used in the elevators and rudder. If it is to be removed, see Section 2.45.12.

Due to dynamic forces at airspeeds above 140 mph, some aircraft may develop an oscillation about the pitch axis if flown with hands off the control stick, and rough air is encountered. Full control of the aircraft is accomplished by hands on the control stick, which will stop the oscillation. The factory has determined that by adding a small amount of friction in the elevator control system, the oscillation is damped with hands off the control stick.
<p>
A friction device has been designed which bolts to the fuselage frame at the support bracket for the elevator idler. This device is shown below in Figure 2-19. Friction is achieved by the clamping action about the elevator idler housing.

<p>
If at any time oscillation is noted when the aircraft is flown hands off, the clamping action of the friction device should be increased. This is accomplished by tightening the bolt as shown above in Figure 2-19. It is called a “damper" and is mounted per drawing <span style="color: red;">XXXXX</span>.
<p>
To measure the amount of friction required conduct the following procedure:
<p><ol><li>Remove the bolt that attaches the damper to the support bracket for the elevator idler.</li>
<li>Wrap a piece of safety wire around the top of the control stick just above the trigger and hook a small fish scale to the safety wire on the aft side of the stick grip.</li>
<li>Measure the pounds of force required to move the control stick from the full forward position to the elevators neutral position. Flaps should be retracted.</li>
<li>Now reinstall the damper to the support bracket.</li>
<li>Tighten the bolt as required to provide a small amount of friction. Attach the fish scale to the control stick and determine the force required to move the stick from the full forward position to the elevators neutral as in step #3.</li>
<li>The <u>additional</u> force should be at least 1.0 lbs., but not more than 3.0 lbs.</li></ol></p>
<p style='color:red;'>Are these values the same for the 500 series as copied from the 802OM? What is the drawing number for the damper?</p>
