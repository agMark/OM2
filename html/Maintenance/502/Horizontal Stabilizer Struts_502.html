    The stabilizer struts attach to the fuselage frame with a AN6C11A bolt and to the stabilizer eyebolts with AN6-11A
    bolts. There are p/n 30256-1 stainless terminals with AN316C8 check nuts at each strut end to allow for adjustment.
</p>
<p>
    The struts are constructed of 2.36 x 1.00 x .049 4130N streamlined tubing and may be repaired if necessary. They are
    oiled internally through the threaded fittings on the ends and should be re-oiled if repaired. They are
    grit-blasted, primed, and finished with yellow Polyurethane paint. At various intervals, the struts should be
    re-sand-blasted and finished as called out above. Be sure to remove the terminals and plug the open holes before
    sandblasting. Oil inside with linseed oil after painting.
</p>

<p>
    The stabilizer struts' leading edges are typically protected with 3M 8671-3 anti-abrasion tape. Thicker protection
    tape or material should not be installed as damage can occur (ref SL409 and SL383). The tape should be periodically
    inspected for condition and replaced as required.

    <p class="boxWarningLargeHeader">WARNING</p>
    <p class="boxWarningLargeText">
        The forward gusset on the inboard end of the struts will erode from having dry fertilizer particles strike the
        lower aft portion of the fuselage structure. Substantial strength reduction of the strut to fuselage connection
        will occur when the gusset is severely eroded. Consult Service Letter #198 for appropriate action.
