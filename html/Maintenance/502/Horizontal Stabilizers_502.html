    The horizontal stabilizers require very little maintenance since they are all metal. They are attached to the
    fuselage frame with two NAS1304-8 bolts which have a washer under the head and two under the nut. On annual
    inspections the gap cover should be removed from the stabilizer and the bolt condition and torque checked. At the
    same time inspect the fuselage fittings closely for cracks. Torque is 100 inch-pounds at the nut. The gap covers are
    attached with 90008-1 stainless self-tapping screws which are Phillips trusshead #4x1/4" long. A No. 39 hole is
    drilled for the screw installation. The S202VW rubber channel is a Cessna part and is attached with 3-M 8001
    Adhesive.

    The stabilizer is sealed on the ends with PR-1422 A2* to prevent chemical entry. There are two eyebolts that attach
    to a welded steel brace inside the stabilizer. The eyebolts are for strut attachment and both eyebolts are AN46-22A
    through s/n 502-0010, and AN47-22A for s/n 502-0011 and subsequent. Under each nut are two AN960-716 washers and the
    nut is a AN365-720. The factory procedure is to align the face of the eyebolts with the strut clevis before the nut
    on the eyebolt is fully torqued (600 inch-pounds). Above the nut is a 7/8 plug button (TRW p/n SS-48155).

    There is a p/n 30137-1 (L/H) and 30137-2 (R/H) trim control idler attached to each stabilizer rear spar on the
    inboard end. Each trim idler has two Bunting P26-10 bushings press fit inside the welded assembly and a p/n 30070-1
    spacer bushing allows the AN3-32A attach bolt to be fully torqued (60 inch-pounds at the nut). The brackets that
    attach the trim idlers are p/n 30049-1 and 30049-2 but should never need replacing unless the AN3-32A bolt has
    become loose and caused wear in the holes.
</p>

<p>
    One of the idler arms is attached to the push-rod connected to the trim tab horn and this arm has a Bunting P19-1
    bushing press-fit into the idler arm. This is the same size bushing in the trim tab horn, and both should be
    replaced when excessive trim tab free-play develops. The Bunting bushings are oil-impregnated, but if new ones are
    installed, fill the bushings to overflowing with general purpose oil and with finger pressure squeeze on the bushing
    ends to force the oil into the small cavities inside the bushings.

    Reports have been received of large birds striking the outboard end of the horizontal tail on various aircraft. In a
    few of the cases, the bird impacted near the gap between the elevator horn and the horizontal stabilizer. The
    damaged surface was pushed into the gap and caused the elevator horn to become obstructed. To help prevent the
    likelihood of jamming, Air Tractor is installing perforated ribs in the elevators and stabilizers of new aircraft.
</p>

<p>
    Air Tractor recommends that all operators, especially those who operate in areas where impact with large birds are
    likely, to have their aircraft modified to perforate the ribs of this area. The perforated ribs will allow the
    unsupported tip of the nose rib to break free if it becomes damaged and reduce the risk of binding. This change will
    also remove two non-structural closeout plates on those aircraft that have them installed. Refer to Service Letter
    #319 for additional information.

    One occurrence has been reported that the elevator controls were jammed when one of the inboard elevator
    counterweight bolts came loose and wedged between the elevator and the horizontal stabilizer. The safety wire on the
    bolt head was still intact and attached to the elevator. Service Letter #282 describes the steps to ensure free
    elevator travel on affected aircraft serial numbers
