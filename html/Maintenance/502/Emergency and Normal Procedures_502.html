    Recently we have become aware that pilots are not fully aware of emergency procedures. There have been accidents
    where we believe that if pilots had been familiar with procedures the outcome may have been different. Take time to
    study the flight manual for your airplane. Learn the emergency procedures so you know what to do when the situation
    arises. From time to time review these procedures to remain familiar with them.

    Different agricultural and fire-fighting delivery systems have different emergency dump systems and procedures.
    Know the emergency dump procedure for the system you are operating.

    Flap settings for takeoff shall always be made before the takeoff is initiated. Depending on the flaps to come down
    halfway down the runway to guarantee lift off and obstacle clearance is not good operating practice. In the event
    the flaps do not come down, the takeoff may not be successful.

    Preflight procedures are an important part of all operations. Be sure to follow the checklist in the flight manual.
    We have seen numerous instances where it was obvious that fuel sump drains had not been activated for extended
    periods of time and the drain valves were stuck shut. Not draining the sumps leads to water accumulating in the fuel
    system and possible in-flight engine shutdown. There have also been instances where the pilot took off without
    enough fuel on board to complete the planned flight.

    Pay particular attention to fuel management procedures. The right- and left-wing fuel tanks are interconnected.
    Uncoordinated flight leads to fuel migration from one tank to the other. The engine may quit when one tank runs dry.
    See Service Letter #178 and #178A for additional information on fuel migration.
