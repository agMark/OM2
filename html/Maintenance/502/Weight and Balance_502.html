The proper maintenance of weight and balance records is important to ensure that the airplane is operated within the weight and center of gravity limits that are established in the Flight Manual. The weight-and-balance diagram with sample calculations is shown below in Figure 2-1. The airplane must be weighed in the attitude described in Section 2.0.5.

<p style='color:red;'>The purpose of Service Letter #304 is to describe the proper procedure for establishing a special purpose operating weight that is higher than the FAA certificated gross weight of the AT-500 series. Service Letter #80AA was previously issued to address this subject, but the subject is worth additional clarification.

<p style='color:red;'>The 500-series Air Tractor aircraft are certificated in the FAA's RESTRICTED category, which allows the aircraft to be used for agricultural dispersal purposes. When these aircraft are operating in the RESTRICTED category, the operator may use the guidance provided in CAM 8 and FAA Advisory Circular No. 20-33B to operate at weights higher than the certificated gross weight that is listed in the Flight Manual.

The methods described in CAM 8 should be used to approve your aircraft for operation at these higher weights. Service Letter #304 provides guidance and clarification that will assist you in properly following the CAM 8 methods. PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO INCORPORATE SL#80AA AND SL#304.
