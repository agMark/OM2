The rudder trim controls in the cockpit are shown in Figure 1-4. Rudder trim is controlled by a horizontal handwheel on the left-hand wall of the cockpit. This handwheel is pushrod connected to a Quadra-Stat sector level in the aft fuselage. The Quadra-Stat is a positioning sector that provides a friction lock at the position selected by the control lever. The Quadra-Stat is shown in Figure 2-26. If the rudder trim slips in flight, the friction screws may be tightened to prevent this.

The Quadra-Stat output arm is connected via pushrods to the idler block that is positioned on the right-hand face of the fin's rear spar, just below the horizontal stabilizer. Dual rods attached to the arms of this idler progress aft to their attachments to the rudder tab.
