    The hopper is made of Derakane and is heat-cured for greater chemical resistance. However, it is not good practice
    to leave chemicals in the hopper overnight if it is known that these chemicals have an adverse effect on fiberglass
    hoppers.

    The hopper brace and the hopper window is sealed on installation with Silicone sealer which is impervious to most
    chemicals. The hopper is attached to the fuselage frame with AN6C24A (4 ea.) and AN6C11A (6 ea.) bolts and
    MS21044-C6 nuts (10 ea.). To remove the hopper, it is necessary to remove these 10 bolts, the screws and nuts on the
    firewall and aft end, the vent tube connection inside the fuselage, and the hopper gate box and plumbing and the
    windshield.

    The hoppers for the above Air Tractor models have painted-on hopper quantity markings on the outside of the hopper
    and the hopper wall inside the cockpit. These markings are intended to be a backup to the panel mounted hopper
    quantity gauge as well as a handy reference when the master switch is turned off.

    If faded or incorrect markings are found, Air Tractor can supply the proper templates and marking materials to
    reapply the markings on the internal or external surfaces of the hopper. Service Letter #325 can provide additional
    information regarding the placement of the markings.<p style='color:red;'>DO THE ABOVE STEPS AND PART NUMBERS APPLY TO 502/504?</p>

    Removal of the hopper allows a very thorough inspection of certain areas that are essential to the safe operation of
    your Air Tractor. These areas include the wing center splice connection, engine mount to fuselage attachment, wing
    to fuselage attach angles, rudder pedal support structure, and the main landing gear attachment. It also facilitates
    servicing components such as flap system bellcranks, flap actuator and brake cylinders. Also wing bolts can be
    checked for torque, and many other necessary inspections and repairs can be easily made. Service Letter #118 can
    provide more guidance on the removal of the hopper.
