    Bolts are to be inspected for thread damage, plating condition, and general appearance by the person making the installation.
<P></P>
Bolts are not to be driven into place. Light tapping with a small hammer is permissible when close tolerance holes and thick materials are involved.
<P></P>
Cadmium plated bolts secured with cadmium plated nuts are installed with dry threads (no lubrication) unless the use of a lubricant is called out in the manual. The threads of all bolts installed in bare steel tapped holes are to be lubricated with a general purpose grease or anti-seize compound. Special lubricants may be called out in the manual (such as the grease for the wing installation bolts). Stainless steel fasteners require the use of a proper anti-seize compound to prevent thread galling. If lubrication is called out for non-stainless steel fasteners, but the lubricant is not specified, a general purpose grease or anti-seize compound is to be used.
<P></P>
The shanks of all bolts installed in bare steel holes shall be coated with a general purpose grease, an anti-seize compound, or other protective lubricant.
<P></P>
When installed, at least one thread of the bolt should be visible above the end of the nut. Nuts must not bottom out on the unthreaded shank of the bolt.
<P></P>
Variation in bolt length or part stack height (due to manufacturing tolerances) sometimes requires the addition of deletion of a washer. A washer is required under the nut. If required to achieve proper thread engagement, two washers may be used under the nut, but a maximum of one washer may be used under the bolt head. If deletion of a washer is required, first delete any non-chamfered washer under the head of the bolt. A thin washer (e.g. AN960 “L") may be substituted for a regular washer where a bolt is a little short.
<P></P>
Torque values for nuts and bolts are shown in the table below. A specific torque callout in the manual supersedes any value listed here. When possible, apply torque to the nut. If it is not possible to apply torque to the nut, use the upper value shown in the table below.

</p>
Notes:
</p>
1.	This chart applies to all standard or high strength aircraft alloy steel bolts.
2.	The lower value is used when the bolt is held stationary and torque is applied to the nut. If the torque must be applied to the bolt (holding the nut stationary), use the upper value.
3.	Tension type nuts are AN310, AN315, AN363, AN365, MS17825, MS20365, MS21042, MS21044, MS21045, MS21046.
4.	Shear type nuts are AN316, AN320, AN364, MS20364, MS21083, NAS509, NAS1423.
5.	Unless otherwise specified, use the shear nut torque for check nuts.
