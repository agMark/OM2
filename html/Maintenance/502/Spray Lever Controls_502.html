Details of the spray-lever controls are shown below in Figure 2-32. The spray lever assembly is attached to the aft cockpit wall and has a micro-control attached to control the spray pressure by limiting the lever travel. Keep the threaded screw on the micro-control greased and make sure the tab on the spray lever contacts only the head of the AN bolt that is attached to the lower adjustment block.

The lower bellcrank is attached to the fuselage frame with a AN bolt on the AT-502A/502B while the AT-504 uses two each AN  bolts. The bellcrank has two Fafnir bearings with a spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued. The bellcrank has a boot and boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with screws and Mil Spec nuts.

<li>Loosen the check nut on the stem of the clevis.</li>
<li>Secure the bellcrank to hold the spray valve in the SPRAY OFF position.</li>
<li>Secure the cockpit spray handle in the desired position for SPRAY OFF.</li>
<li>Adjust the clevis to align with the bolt holes in the bellcrank.</li>
<li>Replace the bolt, washer (s), and nut and retighten the check nut.</li>
<li>Check travel of spray handle in cockpit. If necessary, repeat steps 1 through 6 for best fit.</li>
