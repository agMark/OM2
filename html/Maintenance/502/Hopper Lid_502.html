The hopper lid is made of fiberglass. It is sealed with strips of 3/8"x1.0" medium density nitrile.
The lid will not leak if the nitrile is in good condition and the latch assembly is adjusted to tension the lid solidly against the hopper flange and the four over-center Destaco clamps are properly adjusted. Change the nitrile as required during the spray season.
<p>
The steps for seating the lid solidly against the lid opening are:
<p>
<ol><li>Fabricate a gauge from .010" thick 1"x6" stainless steel sheet.</li>
<li>Loosen all of the lid hold-down clamps.</li>
<li>Lubricate the lower end of the strip with mineral oil and place between the hopper door gasket and hopper flange located beneath one of the center hold-down clamps on the side opposite the hinge.</li>
<li>Clamp the door shut and pull the strip outward free of the gasket. The resistance to pull should be 3-5 lbs.</li>
<li>Adjust the particular hold-down clamp until desired pull is achieved.</li>
<li>Move to other opposite center hold-down clamp opposite the hinge and repeat steps 3 and 4.</li>
<li>Move to one of the outboard hold-down clamps opposite the hinge and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li>
<li>Move to the other outboard hold-down clamp opposite the hinge and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li>
<li>Move to the hold-down clamp farthest from the hinge at the forward end of the door and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li>
<li>Move the hold-down clamp nearest the hinge at the forward end of the door and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li>
<li>Move to the hold-down clamp farthest from the hinge at the aft end of the door and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li>

<li>Move the hold-down clamp nearest the hinge at the aft end of the door and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li></ol>

Should the hopper lid leak, the gasket and mating surface should be examined at the leak for tears or gouges. If the gasket is faulty, it should be replaced. Gouges in the mating flanges of the hopper tank may be treated with conventional fiberglass repair.
