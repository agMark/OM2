<p>
    The hopper lid is of fiberglass and is sealed with strips of medium density nitrile 3/8 x 1.0.
</p>

<p>
    The lid will not leak if the nitrile is in good condition and the latch assembly is adjusted to tension the lid
    solidly against the hopper flange. The nitrile should be changed as required during the spray season.
</p>

<p>The procedures for seating the lid solidly against the lid opening are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Fabricate a gage from .010-thick 1"X6" stainless-steel sheet.</li>
    <li>Remove the two large turnbuckles that control the pitch and rotation of the hopper, and one of the four over-center handles. This will allow movement of the hopper lid.</li>
    <li>Place the gage on each side between the hopper flange and the lid, and then adjust the three remaining over-center handles to give a pressure or feel that is light to moderate. This adjustment should come out to approximately 15 to 20 pounds of pressure per over-center handle when measured with a scale.</li>
</ol>

<p>Should the hopper lid leak, the gasket and mating surface should be examined at the leak for tears or gouges. If the gasket is faulty, it should be replaced. Gouges in the mating flanges of the hopper tank may be treated with conventional fiberglass repair. </p>
