    The hopper lid is of fiberglass and is sealed with strips of medium density nitrile 3/8 x 1.0.

    The lid will not leak if the nitrile is in good condition and the latch assembly is adjusted to tension the lid
    solidly against the hopper flange. The nitrile should be changed as required during the spray season.
