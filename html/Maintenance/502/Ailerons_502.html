    The ailerons are all-metal and require very little maintenance. The lead counterweight will sometimes loosen on the
    long AN3-33A bolt through the lead and the support tube. If this is the case it would be advisable to remove the
    counterweight and support tube and drill and ream for a larger bolt. To do this remove the aileron from the aircraft
    by removing the nuts from the three hinge fittings, removing the four screws in the inspection plate where the
    push-rod attaches to the wing bellcrank, and removing the nut from the bolt through the bellcrank and push-rod. Note
    that there is a spacer washer between the aluminum hinge and the support arm bearing, and that there is a AN970-4
    large washer on the outboard side of the bearing under the bolt head.

    With the AN4-10A bolts pointing inboard, the correct order of parts would be a AN970-4 washer under the bolt head,
    then a AN960-416L washer, then the bearing, then a AN960-416 washer, then the aluminum aileron hinge, then a
    AN960-416 washer, then a AN365-428A nut. The steel inboard hinge uses a AN4-25A bolt, with a AN960-416 washer under
    the head, then the steel hinge, then the bearing, then a AN970-4 washer, then a AN960-416 washer, then a AN365-428A
    nut. Leave the push-rod attached to the aileron and reach through the inspection plate opening and remove the bolt
    attaching the push-rod to the wing bellcrank. Be sure to have someone holding up on the aileron trailing edge, and
    the control stick lock should be in place. Then remove the center hinge bolt, with someone at each end of the
    aileron, remove the two outboard bolts, lift up on the push-rod to keep it from dragging, and remove the aileron
    from the aircraft.

    While the aileron is removed, check the aluminum hinges for secure attachment to the spar, and check the steel hinge
    for signs of corrosion, or loose rivets, or cracks in the welded areas. Inspect both ends of the push-rods for
    cracks in the threads, check the rod-end bearing (Fafnir RE4F6-2) for condition and lubrication, and be sure the
    check nut against the bearing is snug.

    After the aileron has been re-installed and an inspection of all connections has been made, reach through the
    inspection plate opening and check to see if the push-rod is free to rotate slightly as the aileron is moved through
    the full range of travel. After being sure the bolt through the push-rod and wing bellcrank has been torqued,
    re-install the inspection plate with the four screws.

    The bearings in the aileron support arms are Fafnir KP4A and make a press-fit into the 1/4" aluminum arm and are
    staked on both sides. These bearings are sealed, require no lubrication, and should not require replacement in
    service.
