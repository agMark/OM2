The ailerons are all-metal and require very little maintenance. The lead counterweight will sometimes loosen on the long bolt through the lead weight and the support tube. If this occurs, it is advisable to remove the counterweight and support tube and then drill and ream for a larger bolt. This procedure is detailed in Section 2.10.2. <span style="color: red;">Hyperlink here?</span>

To remove the aileron from the aircraft, the technician must remove the nuts from the three hinge fittings, remove the four screws in the inspection plate where the pushrod attaches to the wing bellcrank and remove the nut from the bolt through the bellcrank and pushrod. Note that there is a spacer washer between the aluminum hinge and the support arm bearing and a AN970 large washer on the outboard side of the bearing under the bolt head. Leave the pushrod attached to the aileron and reach through the inspection plate opening to remove the bolt attaching the pushrod to the wing bellcrank. Engage the control stick lock and have someone hold up on the aileron trailing edge. Remove the center hinge bolt, and with someone at each end of the aileron, remove the two outboard bolts. Lift up on the pushrod to keep it from dragging and remove the aileron from the aircraft, placing it on a soft and stable surface. A diagram showing the procedure to remove and install the aileron is shown below in Figure 2-2.

After the aileron is removed, inspect the aluminum hinges for secure attachment to the spar, the steel hinge for signs of corrosion and loose rivets or cracks in the welded areas. Inspect both ends of the push-rods for cracks in the threads, checking the rod-end bearing for condition and lubrication. Be sure the check nut against the bearing is snug.

When reinstalling the aileron (with the bolts pointing inboard) the correct part order is a AN970 washer under the bolt head, AN960L washer, bearing, AN960 washer, aluminum aileron hinge, AN960 washer and AN365 nut. The steel inboard hinge uses a AN bolt with a AN960 washer under the head, steel hinge, bearing, AN970 washer, AN960 washer and AN365 nut. After the aileron has been reinstalled and an inspection of all connections has been made, reach through the inspection plate opening and check to see if the pushrod is free to rotate slightly as the aileron is moved through the full range of travel. After ensuring that the bolt through the pushrod and wing bellcrank has been torqued, reinstall the inspection plate using the four screws.

Rechecking the control surface travel at this point is highly recommended.

The bearings in the aileron support arms are manufactured by Fafnir, press-fit into the aluminum arm and staked on both sides. These bearings are sealed, need no lubrication and should not require replacement during normal service.
