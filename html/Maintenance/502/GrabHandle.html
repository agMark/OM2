<p>
    The grab handles are secured to the overturn structure with a bracket and clamps.  Washers are used to make up the gab between the attachment bracket and the canopy
    to reduce the risk of cracking of the canopy.  Air Tractor suggests that you replace the bolt that secures the grab handle to the bracket at the interval shown
