<p><p style='color:red;'>DOES 500 SERIES HAVE THIS INTERCONNECT SYSTEM? IF SO, ARE THE DRAWINGS AND VALUES CORRECT? The following copied directly from 802OM and edited to remove part numbers.</p>

<p><b><u>Rigging Instructions</u></b></p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Ensure flaps are rigged.  Completely retract the flaps to the 0° position.</li>

    <li>Disconnect the elevator down spring where it
        connects to the aft elevator controls idler. This can be done with the flight control stick in the full forward
        position. </li>

    <li>After the spring is disconnected, lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit
        control lock. Confirm the elevators are in the neutral position. </li>

    <li>Check the hole-to-hole length of the pushrod that connects the flap torque tube to the cable
        tensioner assembly. This length should be <span style="color: red;">XXX</span> inches. </li>

    <li>Check the lateral placement of the cable tensioner assembly and the clamp arm. The center of
        both of these assemblies should be <span style="color: red;">XXX</span> inches to the left of the aircraft centerline. Note that the
        lower aileron torque tube is centered on the aircraft centerline and can be used as the centerline reference for
        this measurement. If required, adjust the tensioner assembly and the clamp arm to this dimension.

    </li>



    <li>Tighten the clamp bolts for the tensioner assembly to secure it in place. Leave the clamp bolts on the clamp arm loose for now. </li>

    <li>Ensure the pushrod is installed, connecting the tensioner assembly and the clamp arm as shown above.
    </li>

    <li>Rotate the tensioner assembly to the <span style="color: red;">XX</span>° nominal angle shown below. Note that the holes in the tensioner bearing
        can be used to “eyeball" this angle. Allow the clamp arm to rotate on the flap torque tube as necessary. When the tensioner is at the <span style="color: red;">XX</span>° angle, tighten the clamp arm bolts to secure the clamp arm to the flap torque
        tube.

    </li>


    <li>Reconnect the elevator control down spring to the aft elevator control idler. With the flaps retracted and elevators neutral, the length of the down spring (excluding the hooks) should measure <span style="color: red;">XXX</span> inches. To
        adjust this length, adjust the length of the pushrod. </li>

    <li>After the initial down spring length is set, check the cable routing for pulleys that are out of alignment,
        cable
        contact with any structure. </li>

    <li>Ensure that all hardware is tight and all rod end check nuts are properly tightened. </li>

    <li>Actuate the flaps through their full range of motion and watch the cable tensioner and pushrod for any
        interference or binding. </li>
