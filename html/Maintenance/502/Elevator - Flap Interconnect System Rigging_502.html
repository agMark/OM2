<p><b><u>Rigging Instructions</u></b></p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Ensure flaps are rigged.  Completely retract the flaps to the 0° position.</li>

    <li>Disconnect the elevator down spring where it connects to the aft elevator controls idler. This can be done with the flight control stick in the full forward
        position. </li>

    <li>After the spring is disconnected, lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit
        control lock. </li>

    <li>Manually position the flaps to 10° of flap deflection. The flaps must be positioned at exactly 10°. Position the
        flap disconnect linkage so that the flap position indicator in the cockpit reads 10°. </li>

    <li>At the same time the flaps are at 10°, check to see if the elevator is in the neutral position. If the elevator
        is not in neutral at the 10° flap position, adjust the length of the interconnect linkage until the elevator is
        in neutral when the flaps are at 10°. </li>

    <li>Move the flaps through their complete range of deflection. Confirm that the elevator does not reach an up or down
        stop when the flaps are being positioned. If binding or a stop is reached, troubleshoot and correct the problem. </li>

    <li>Restore the elevator down spring to its proper position. </li>

    <li>Manually deflect the elevator full travel (up and down) and confirm that no binding or rubbing occurs at any
        deflection. </li>
