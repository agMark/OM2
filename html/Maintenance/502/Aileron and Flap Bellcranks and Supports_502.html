The 180˚ bellcrank under the cockpit floor is interchangeable right to left. The welding operation on these bellcranks sometimes causes a slight warp which will reduce the clearance from the support frame. If the bellcranks are changed, be sure there is ample clearance. If necessary, reverse the direction of the clevis bolt that connects the pushrods to improve the clearance. These bellcranks have Fafnir bearings installed with a stainless spacer that allows the AN bolt that connects the bellcrank to the support frame assembly to be fully torqued (100 inch-pounds at the nut).

The support frame is attached to the floor structure with a AN bolt. There are two Fafnir bearings in the support frame and a stainless bushing allows full bolt torque just like the bellcrank. The bearings are sealed and require no lubrication. Some end play may develop due to tolerance accumulation--up to 
.040" is allowed.

The aileron bellcranks in the wings are attached to a welded structure with an AN bolt and have a stainless spacer to allow full bolt torque. These bearings are also manufactured by Fafnir. The wing bellcranks have a maximum end play of .03" and the bolt attaching the bellcrank may be reached by removing the plug buttons on the top and bottom wing skins. To remove the bellcrank from the wing it is necessary to remove some rivets on the lower wing skin. Attempt to remove only rivets that can be easily reached during reinstallation.
