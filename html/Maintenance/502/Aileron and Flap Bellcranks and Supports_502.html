    The 180˚ bellcrank under the cockpit floor is p/n 70076-1 and is interchangeable right to left. The welding
    operation on these bellcranks sometimes causes a slight warp which will reduce the clearance from the 70072- 1
    support frame, so if the bellcranks are changed, be sure there is ample clearance and if necessary, reverse the
    direction of the AN24-19A clevis bolt that connects the push-rods to improve clearance. These bellcranks have Fafnir
    KP6A bearings installed with a 70081-2 stainless spacer that allows the AN4-42A bolt that connects the bellcrank to
    the support frame assembly to be fully torqued (100 inch-pounds at the nut).

    The support frame (p/n 70072-1) is attached to the floor structure with a AN4-50A bolt. There are two Fafnir KP6A
    bearings in the support frame and a 70081-1 stainless bushing allows full bolt torque same as with the 70076-1
    bellcrank. The KP6A bearings are sealed and require no lubrication. Some end play will develop due to tolerance
    accumulation, but up to .040" is acceptable.

    The aileron bellcranks in the wings are attached to a welded structure with an AN4-46A bolt and have a p/n 70081-3
    stainless spacer to allow full bolt torque. Bearings are Fafnir KP6A. The wing bellcranks are p/n 70079-1 (L/H) and
    70079-2 (R/H). Maximum end play of the wing bellcrank is .03". The bolt attaching the wing bellcranks may be reached
    by removing the plug buttons (11/16) on the top and bottom skins. To remove the bellcrank from the wing it is
    necessary to remove some rivets attaching the lower wing skin. Remove rivets that can be easily reached for
    re-installation.
