The airplane can be towed with the use of an appropriate tow bar attached to the main landing gear. The proper towing points are the metal rings on the inner side of the landing gear strut in the same plane as the axle. Towing with attachment to the tail-wheel spring is not recommended. The tail-wheel lock should always be disengaged while the airplane is being towed.
<p>
A towing bar can be made from two 12-foot-long 4130 steel tubes and a three-quarter-inch steel bar. The tubes outside diameter should not be less than two inches and the wall thickness should be at or above .065 inch.
<p>
The tubes are pinned together at one end with a loose 1/2-inch bolt and an attachment to join to the towing lug or ball on a vehicle. The three-quarter-inch steel bar is bent at 90 degrees with six inches of bar extending in one direction and three inches in the other direction from the bend. These bent bars are welded to the free ends of the tubes. The three-inch leg is pointed downward, and the other is fillet-welded to the outside of the tube. These downward projecting pintles fit loosely into the towing rings in the airplane's landing gear. A hole may be drilled through the three-inch leg at a quarter inch from its end for a spring pin, if desired.
<p>
The airplane can be pulled or pushed using the tow bar. If the airplane is towed into tight quarters, a wing-walker should be used to avoid damage to wing tips and tail members where visibility is limited.
<p>
The airplane should not be towed faster than 5 miles per hour on a smooth surface without potholes or sharp bumps. Landing gear damage, particularly tail-wheel damage, can result from dropping the gear into holes at high speeds.
<p>
Excessively bumpy surfaces must be navigated cautiously to avoid landing gear damage. Also, bumpy surfaces may cause the tow bar to bounce and disengage from the tow rings on the landing gear. Should this occur, directional control of the airplane is lost. A gentle stop should be executed immediately to minimize damage. The safest approach to towing on bumpy surfaces is to station a crew member in the pilot's seat to apply the airplane's brakes if the hitch or tow bar fails or disengages. Use of a spring pin through the drilled holes minimizes the likelihood of disconnecting on a rough surface.
<p>
Sloped surfaces with a grade more than ten degrees should be approached diagonally to reduce the load on the tow bar and hitch points.
<p>
Sudden starts and stops must be avoided, particularly with a filled airplane, to prevent failure of the tow bar or towing rings.
