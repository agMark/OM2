    Every ag or firefighting pilot faces various risks and hazards every time they conduct their missions. There is a
    tremendous amount of training, experience, and awareness that goes into mitigating these risks and avoiding the
    known hazards that these pilots face. In addition, Air Tractor aircraft are also purposefully designed to mitigate
    these risks and help protect the pilot. One thing that a pilot should not have to worry about is the approval of the
    parts installed on their aircraft.

    All aviation parts and materials go through extensive engineering and quality control processes which enable their
    use in the safety critical applications on aircraft around the world. These processes are the fundamental to the
    effort of keeping pilots and maintainers safe. Using unapproved parts on an aircraft that you operate or maintain is
    not only risky, but also in violation of the regulations.
