    The gate box is Transland 25559 and a set of gate box gaskets is used on each side of the fiberglass enclosure skin when the gate box is installed. Since these gaskets are usually ruined when the gate box is removed, new ones should be used when the gate box is re-installed. The gaskets used are 60725 (4 ea.), 60227 (4 ea.). Silicone sealer is used only on the corners of the gaskets, and it is possible that this sealer is not required. The hopper door seal is a Transland 60713.

    On serial numbers -0230 through -0320 there was a fault found in the design of the calibrator is of not being able to know the position of the gate stop before fertilizing or seeding operations began. This problem has been addressed and corrected. There is now a gate stop position indicator that can easily be retrofitted in the field to all above listed aircraft that were produced with the new style calibrator. See additional information in Service Letter #137A.
