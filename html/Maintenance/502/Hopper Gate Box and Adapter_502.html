Details of the hopper gate box are shown below in Figure 2-29 and details of the hopper adapter are shown in Figure 2-30. The gate box and adapter are manufactured by Transland. Newer aircraft may have different gaskets. The table below shows the two types of gaskets that can be used.

Gaskets for both should be replaced when either is removed. Original and new gaskets should not be mixed when replacing. Gaskets for the adapter to gate box connection are available from Transland or Air Tractor. Bolts for attaching the adaptor to the hoppers and for attaching the gatebox are stainless steel. These bolts are installed with stainless AN washers and Mil Spec nuts. Gaskets should be sealed on both sides. Bolt torque is 150 inch-pounds.
