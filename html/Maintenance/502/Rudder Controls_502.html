    The rudder cables are p/n 70095-6 and attach to stainless link plates (p/n 70094-1) at the rudder horn with AN4C10
    bolts, AN310C4 nuts, AN960C416 washers, MS24665-151 cotters. There are four MS24566- 3B pulleys in the rudder cable
    system to the cockpit.
</p>

<p>
    In the cockpit, the rudder cables attach to a steel p/n 70096-1 plate which is bolted to a p/n 70101-1 aluminum
    adjust channel. Also attached to the 70096-1 plate is a p/n 70098-1 cable assembly which interconnects the rudder
    with the aileron control system. The interconnect springs under the cockpit floor are p/n 70103-1 and attach to a
    MS21255-3LS cable eye, MS21251B3S barrel, MS21255-3RS cable eye, AN100C4 thimble and 18-2-G Nicopress sleeve.
</p>

<p>
    The rudder pedal hanger assembly (p/n 70109-1) slides in the adjust channel and is held in place with a D5-10T-303
    Faspin. The hanger assembly has a spring attached to pull it forward to remove slack from the rudder cable. The
    spring is attached to an eyebolt in the hanger assembly and is p/n 70102-1.
</p>

<p>
    The rudder pedal castings are p/n 70115-1 (L/H) and 70115-2 (R/H) and may be removed by taking out the AN3 bolt
    though the p/n 1SC Caplug on the inboard end of the hanger assembly and removing the AN4-10 bolt attaching the
    master cylinder strap. The castings should be removed at 2,000-hour intervals and inspected for cracks around the
    bronze bushing (p/n 70116-1), bushing wear, and general condition. Grease the hanger assembly and slide the casting
    back in place. Be sure to use the AN310-4 castle nut with a MS24665-151 cotter on the AN4-10 bolt connecting the
    master cylinder strap. Also, be sure an AN960-416 washer is installed between the strap and casting and work the
    brake several times to be sure clearance exists between the strap and the casting. While the casting is removed,
    check the condition of the (p/n 70492-1) bronze bushing in the master cylinder strap (p/n 70490-1). Oil the bronze
    bushings with a general- purpose oil before re-installing the bolts.

    The rudder cables are part number 71959-1 and attach to stainless steel link plates (p/n 70094-1) at the rudder horn
    with AN4C10 bolts, AN310C4 nuts, AN960C416 washers, MS24665-151 cotters. There are two MS2456-3B pulleys in the
    rudder cable system to the cockpit.

<p>
    The forward end of the rudder cables attaches to the 71774-1/-2 bellcrank assemblies along with 71960-1 cable
    assembly which interconnects the rudder with the aileron control system. The interconnect springs under the cockpit
    floor are p/n 70103-1 and attach to a MS21255-3LS cable eye, MS21251B3S barrel, MS21255-3RS cable eye, AN100-C4
    thimble, and 18-2G Nicopress sleeve.
</p>

<p>
    The 71774-1/-2 bellcrank assemblies are interconnected with a 71952-3 pushrod assembly, and four 71958-1 pushrod
    assemblies run forward to p/n 70313-1 aluminum adjust channel. The rudder pedal hanger assembly (p/n 71962-1/-2)
    slides in the adjust channel and is held in place with a D5-10T-303 Faspin.

    The rudder pedal castings are p/n 71750-1 (L/H) and 71750-2 (R/H) and may be removed by taking out the AN3 bolt
    through the p/n 200 SC 1.0" Caplug on the inboard end of the hanger assembly and removing the AN4-21 bolt attaching
    the master cylinder strap. The castings should be removed at 2,000-hour intervals and inspected for cracks around
    the bronze bushing (p/n 70116-1), bushing wear, and general condition. Grease the hanger assembly and slide the
    casting back in place. Be sure to use the AN310-4 castle nut with MS24665-151 cotter on the AN4-21 bolt connecting
