The rudder cables  attach to stainless link plates  at the rudder horn with AN bolts, nuts, washers and Mil Spec cotter pins. There are four pulleys in the rudder cable system to the cockpit.
<p>
In the cockpit, the rudder cables attach to a steel plate which is bolted to an adjustable aluminum channel. Also attached to the plate is a cable assembly which interconnects the rudder with the aileron control system. The interconnect springs under the cockpit floor attach to the cable assemblies connected to the upper torque tube.
<p>
The rudder pedal hanger assembly slides into the adjustable channel and is held in place with a Faspin. The hanger assembly has a spring attached to pull it forward to remove slack from the rudder cable. The spring is attached to an eyebolt in the hanger assembly.
The rudder pedal castings may be removed by taking out the AN bolt through the Caplug on the inboard end of the hanger assembly and removing the AN bolt attaching the master cylinder strap.

<b>Rudder Pedal Inspection</b>
<p>
Remove castings and inspect the bronze bushing for cracks, wear and general condition. Grease the hanger assembly and slide the casting back in place. Be sure to use the AN castle nut with an Mil Spec cotter pin on the AN bolt connecting the master cylinder strap. Also, be sure two AN washers are installed between the strap and casting and work the brake several times to be sure clearance exists between the strap and the casting. While the casting is removed, check the condition of the bronze bushing in the master cylinder strap. Oil the bronze bushings with general purpose oil before re-installing the bolts.
