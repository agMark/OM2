    The elevators are attached to the stabilizers and to the pedestal in the fuselage with AN4-10A bolts, with a
    AN960-416 washer under the bolt head and two washers under the AN365-428A nut except at the pedestal where only one
    washer is under the nut. The elevator horns connect to the aft push-rod with a AN4- 10A bolt, two AN960-416 washers
    (placed to give maximum fuselage clearance), and a AN365-428A nut.

    Like the rudder, the elevators and center pedestal have NMB p/n ABT4 spherical bearings installed, and due to
    bearing drag, it is very important for all bolts connecting the elevators and the horns to be fully torqued (100
    inch-pounds at the nut). We have seen elevator horns with badly elongated holes because the elevators had been
    replaced in the field and the bolts were not fully torqued.
</p>

<p>
    A repair for elongated holes in the horns has been to drill out the holes to 9/32", ream with a special .3120 reamer
    (available at the factory if required), and installing a press-fit 4130N steel bushing. 3125 to .3130 O.D. x .250
    I.D. x .080 long. With the bushing in place, heli-arc weld the bushing to the horn in two places with 1/8" long weld
    beads. Then sand, etch, and paint with Air Ag Yellow epoxy.

    To replace the bearings, see the section on “Rudder” for instructions.

    Elevator stops are at the elevator horn. The down stop has a p/n 70067-1 neoprene washer in compression to absorb
    shocks and sometimes this washer splits and falls out so during 100-hour inspections, check to see if this washer is
    in place. Also, if the control stick is pulled back sharply against the up stop or if a wind gust blows the elevator
    up, the up-stop bracket will bend and should be straightened if found to be bent.

    Elevator travel is 29˚ up, 16˚ down, +/-1˚.
