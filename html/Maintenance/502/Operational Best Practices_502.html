    Over time fertilizers & agricultural chemicals can be detrimental to your aircraft. Owners & operators of
    agricultural equipment have been battling corrosion for years. It does not matter if you operate big tractors,
    ground spray rigs, or an Air Tractor aircraft, corrosion is not discriminatory. Air Tractor airplanes benefit from
    decades of in-service experience that has resulted in many protection features including improved
    primer/paint/plating, sealants, drains, and design details to minimize trapped contaminates. But you are ultimately
    on the front-line defense to fight against corrosion.

    Many experienced Air Tractor operators maintain a strict schedule for routine cleaning of their aircraft. For
    airplanes operated in corrosive environments it is a best practice to clean them daily. This is a reminder of the
    importance of proper cleaning. This has been noted in prior service letters 278, 283, 299 & 385. The following steps
    are recommended to greatly reduce the possibility of corrosion.

    <li>
        Wash your aircraft regularly when it has been exposed to saltwater or corrosive chemicals. Use fresh water (we
        do not recommend using well water). Use caution if you choose to use a pressure washer as to not damage painted
        or coated surfaces or other delicate equipment. Use a brush for getting in all those small joints on your
        airframe. Fuselage side skins are removed and contaminates flushed out. Dry with clean towels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not use strong soaps, detergents, or cleaning agents containing acid, caustic, or abrasives. Use commercially
        available car wash (non-detergent) products which will not remove protective wax.
    </li>
    <li>
        All cleaning agents should be rinsed promptly and not allowed to dry on the paint surface. Also, many
        fertilizers absorb water, so it is important to get the debris off the airplane and let it dry, whenever
        possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Waxing your aircraft occasionally is recommended to remove residue and further protect the paint finish. Do not
        use waxes containing abrasive compounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Always inspect paint surface during washing or waxing for scratches or chips. Repaint or touchup any area where
        the paint is damaged.
    </li>
    <li>
        Protective coatings such as Par Al Ketone (Black Bear) or Corrosion X can be used to help extend the service
        life of internal working components such as rod end bearings, and pulleys.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The best tools to fight corrosion are fresh water, a good acid-free detergent soap, a brush for getting in all those
    small joints on your airframe, dry towels, and a good wax. Coupled with protective coatings and a strict cleaning
    schedule, these simple practices will help keep your airplane looking great, performing well, avoiding maintenance
    and costly annuals and ultimately protect your investment.
