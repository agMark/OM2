    Continuity of the aircraft flight control systems is one of the most important factors that affects safety of
    flight. A structural disconnect in the flight control systems can result in serious consequences including loss of
    control or aircraft instability. These situations can result in a potentially fatal crash or accident.
    Unfortunately, problems with flight control continuity can arise when an airplane is being modified or maintained.
    This could happen on a new airplane as it is being modified for final delivery to the customer, or when an airplane
    is undergoing maintenance.

    Inspecting the continuity of the aircraft flight control systems can be accomplished in a relatively short period of
    time and requires no special tools. Air Tractor strongly recommends that an inspection be performed to ensure
    control continuity and proper installation of control system hardware. This inspection should be performed before
    the first flight, when taking receipt of a new airplane or after an airplane has undergone any significant
    maintenance. Service Letter #340 can be used as an excellent guide to perform such inspections.

    Loose items in the cockpit of Air Tractor planes could cause interference with the flight controls. Interference
    with the flight controls during operation could lead to loss of control of an airplane and a crash. It is
    recommended that the cockpit be inspected to ensure that it is clean and that there are no loose items, such as
    clothing, drink cans, etc., in the cockpit before each flight.

    For AT-501 & AT-502 Aircraft thru s/n 0158--there has been at least two reports of failure of the control stick yoke
    bolt occurring while the airplane was parked outside during extremely high winds. These bolt failures occurred when
    the wind was blowing from the rear of the airplane. In all instances the bolt failed completely, and the failure was
    obvious. The factory now installs NAS1304-44 bolts to replace the AN4-31A bolts that were originally used. The NAS
    bolts are considerably stronger and should decrease the possibility of failure. Any aircraft with the AN bolts still
    installed should change to the NAS bolts used by the factory.
