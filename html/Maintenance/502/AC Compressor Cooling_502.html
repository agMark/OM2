<p>On new production Air Tractor aircraft, the compressor is cooled with a blast air tube that scoops air from the lower cowling.</p>

<p>This duct should be checked for security and that it is not plugged with foreign debris at regular intervals.</p>


<p>
    Serial numbers 502-0003 thru 502B-0492 (with air conditioning installed) were not originally manufactured with the
    blast tube directed at the air conditioning clutch. This blast tube helps to mitigate the high heat the clutch
    experiences and helps to prolong its useful service life. If your aircraft does not have this blast tube installed,
    refer to Service Letter #168 for further information.
