<p>
    The ailerons are rigged with the trailing edge 1/8" to 3/16" below the flap trailing edge so that flight loads will
    bring the trailing edge up approximately even with the flap trailing edge. Aileron travel (with flaps up) is 20˚ up
    (+/-1˚) and 14˚o down (+/- 1˚). Aileron control stops are located under the cockpit floor on each side of the torque
    tube horn. The adjustment consists of tightening or loosening the bolts that compress a stack of 6 to 7 neoprene
    washers (p/n 70067-1). The neoprene washers act as shock absorbers for the control system, but sometimes split and
    fall out, so it is advisable to inspect the stops during annual inspections.

    The aileron and flap control system components under the cockpit floor are rigged as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Set the control lock on the stick. Flaps full up.
    </li>

    <li>
        Check the length of the push rod assembly (p/n 70014-2) that connects the flap torque tube to the 90˚ bellcrank.
        It should measure 6.65" from bearing hole to bearing hole.
    </li>
    <li>
        Check the length of the push-rod assembly (p/n 70014-4) that connects the 90˚ bellcrank to the rectangular
        welded support frame assembly (p/n 70072-1). It should measure 13.78".
    </li>
    <li>
        Check the length of the push-rod assembly (p/n 70347-1) that connects the aileron control horn to the 180˚
        bellcrank. It should measure 19.88".
    </li>
    <li>
        With all push-rods the correct length, the 70072-1 support frame assembly should clear the fuselage vertical
        tube at the bottom approximately 1/4".
    </li>
    <li>
        The push rod assembly (p/n 70014-1) that connects the wing bellcrank to the aileron will be approximately 10.69"
        long but this is the push-rod that is adjusted to provide the necessary trailing edge setting with respect to
        the flap.
    </li>
</ol>
