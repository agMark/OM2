    The cantilever vertical fin is attached to the fuselage frame at the front spar location with two NAS1306-13 bolts
    and AN365-624 nuts. It has been found that these two bolts tend to loosen in service. No doubt buffeting from the
    propeller slipstream during run-up and stresses from turns tend to produce constant loads from side to side that
    tend to loosen the nuts.

    Check the torque on the two NAS1306-13 bolts at 300-hour intervals. If the bolt is held stationary and the torque
    wrench applied to the nut, the torque value should be 420 inch-pounds. For the reverse of this procedure, torque
    should be 460 inch-pounds.

    The rear spar attaches to the fuselage frame with AN3 bolts of various lengths, depending on the amount of shims
    required between the fuselage frame and the rear spar. The shims are of various thickness (.063, .080, .125) and the
    upper shims are combinations of p/n 30159-1, -2, or -3 while the lower shims are combinations of p/n 30160-1, -2, or
    -3.

    The vertical fin rear spar is drilled on installation where the attachment is made to top longeron. If a new fin is
    installed, make a drill template from the original fin rear spar in order to drill the four 3/16" holes for the
    attachment to the upper longeron. The template should be 2.44" wide and long enough to pick up the two lower attach
    bolts. The template should be made of either aluminum or steel, at least .063" thick.

    Install the fin on the aircraft and install the bolts at the front and rear spar locations. Be sure the correct
    number of shims is used between the fuselage frame and the rear spar. The NAS1306-13 front spar bolts have a torque
    of 420 inch-pounds at the nut. The rear spar bolts have a torque of 60 inch-pounds at the nut.

    Aircraft serial numbers prior to 502A/502B-3059 & 504-4029 may have come from the factory with standard AN bolts. If
    the aircraft is so equipped, it is recommended that the 6 each bolts and nuts installed through the vertical fin
    rear spar be replaced with NAS1303 bolts and MS21042-3 nuts as are being used on current production airplanes. The
    Owner's Manual may be used as a guide for bolt installation. Be aware that the AN bolt length dash numbers are not
    the same as the NAS bolt dash numbers for a given length.
