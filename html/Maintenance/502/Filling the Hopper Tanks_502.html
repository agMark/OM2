    It is recommended that you do not exceed a rate of 400 gallons per minute when filling hoppers of Air Tractors. As
    the hopper nears full you should slow down the fill rate, by closing down the bottom load valve, to prevent
    hydraulic lock of the hopper when it is full and the vent check valve closes. The new style hopper vent valve has a
    rubber seal that the float ball seats against providing near leak proof seal. The float ball valve sits in a cage.
    High rate filling causes a large quantity of air to exhaust through the vent system. If the rate of air flow is high
    enough, it is possible that the ball is lifted out of the cage and to the seat. This would close off the vent system
    and cause the hopper to "pressure up".  Refer to Service Letter #201 for further information.

    For models equipped with the 81438 hopper fill vent ball switch, there has been a case where the fill vent shaft
    coupler allowed the ball switch to become out of rig. This prevented the vent ball from contacting the seat when the
    hopper was filled, thus allowing chemical to be vented overboard in flight.

    To help prevent this we have redesigned the shaft coupler. The old-style coupler was a section of hose with two
    screw clamps. This coupler was susceptible to chemical deterioration and would allow the shafts to slip.The new
    coupler is a stainless-steel collar secured with two 3/32" roll pins. This will insure a secure connection of the
    two shafts.
