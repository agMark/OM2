<p>
    The PT6A engine requires a large amount of air at full power settings. To handle this load while adequately cleaning
    the air, your Air Tractor is equipped with large, efficient air filters. The length of service for these filters
    depends entirely on the operating conditions. When you replace these filters, use the original equipment filters for
    replacement. Cheaper, aftermarket filters are not the same quality, so they neither perform as well nor last as
    long. Remember, your engine requires a lot of air to perform properly. Check the condition of the filters often to
    determine the replacement intervals for your flying conditions. Filters should be inspected/cleaned/replaced in
    accordance with the Inspection Schedule is Section 3. Illumination of the Air Filter CAUTION light indicates that
    normal air flow through the filter is restricted. Should the Air Filter CAUTION light illuminate, land as soon as
    practical and service the air filter system including cleaning or replacing the filter(s) as necessary. (See
    instruction below). Do not rely on this light to determine air filter cleaning/replacement intervals.

    For aircraft with the large, cylindrical commercial truck filters (Donaldson p/n P182043 (alternate is P510337) for
    the AT-502B/504 and Donaldson p/n P181008 (alternate is P510335) for the AT-502A), removal of these filters is
    accomplished by removing the airscoop assembly and the aft lower engine cowl. There is a 3/8” bolt with a check nut
    on the aft center of each filter, and it is necessary to loosen this bolt before the filters can be removed. The
    bolt is to press the filters against the forward wall of the filter box for a tight seal. With the filters loose,
    the small support angles are removed, and the filters will slide out the bottom opening. These filters may be
    cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter #257. The filters are installed in reverse order of
    removal.
</p>

<p>
    For AT-502A/502B/504 aircraft (only 502A aircraft with the PT6A-140AG engine) with the Donaldson p/n P613731 Ram Air
    filter, removal of the filter is accomplished by removing the lower cowl skin and the six AN3 bolts that hold the
    filter access cover to the aft plenum bulkhead. Remove the filter by pulling it through this access opening. These
    filters may also be cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter 257. The filters are installed in
    reverse order of removal.

<p>
    Operators wishing to retrofit the Donaldson P609713 pleated filter element to an aircraft that is currently equipped
    with the Brackett BA-413E foam filter element should refer to Service Letter #348 for further instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Operators wishing to retrofit the Donaldson P613731 pleated filter element to their aircraft that are currently
    equipped with the BA-409E Brackett foam filter element should refer to Service Letter #339 for further instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Refer to Service Letter #288 to provide guidance for modifying the Air Tractor ram air system to allow installation
    of a Brackett Aircraft BA-409E air filter in place of the existing Donaldson P613731 filter.
</p>

<p>
    For AT-502A (all engines except the PT6A-140AG) aircraft with the p/n 52427-17 Ram Air filter, removal of the filter
    is accomplished by removing the lower and side cowl skins from the aircraft. Then completely remove the lower plenum
    cover to gain access to the filter. From the righthand side of the airplane, remove the filter retaining band on the
    aft plenum bulkhead by removing the eight bolts that hold it in place. The heads of these bolts are on the aft side
    of the aft plenum bulkhead. Lastly remove the filter by loosening the four worm drive clamps that hold the filter in
    place. This filter may be cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter 257. The filters are
    installed in reverse order of removal.
</p>

<p>
    For aircraft with the Brackett BA-409E (AT-502B/504 and AT-502A with PT6A-140AG engine) or BA-413E (AT-502A with
    PT6A-45R/60AG/65AG engines) foam Ram Air filter, removal of the filter element is accomplished by removing the lower
    and side engine cowls and the lower engine plenum cover. Remove the center filter support rods by removing the screw
    on the forward end and sliding them out of their retaining brackets at the aft end. Remove the old filter element
    and replace with a new one, ensuring that the filter element completely fills the stainless-steel frame, especially
    in the corners. Replace the filter support rods, plenum cover, and cowl skins in reverse order of removal. This
    filter should not be cleaned, as this may remove the wettant and decrease the filtering ability of the foam. Any
    excess dirt or debris that has accumulated on the forward face of the filter may be brushed off with a bristle
    brush, like a paintbrush, and vacuumed out of the plenum. The Brackett air filter has a maximum recommended service
    life of 12 calendar months, regardless of the actual flight time. The reason is to ensure that acceptable levels of
    wettant remain in the filter to adequately capture dust and debris.

    Installation/retrofit of the 53404-1 Fine Particle Engine Air Filter will provide increased filtration efficiency
    and increased induction system efficiency. The installation provided utilizes prebuilt assemblies which will reduce
    total field installation time and effort. Installation entails removal and replacement of the complete engine plenum
    installation with exception of the nose bowl and intake tunnel. Additional details can be found in Service Letter
    #365.

    The turbine powered Air Tractor models are equipped with a Differential Pressure switch (also known as a “Delta-P
    Switch”) that monitors the pressure drop across the engine air filter. This switch is mounted on the upper aft side
    of the engine plenum. This pressure switch is made by Dwyer and has a stamped sheet metal cover that is held in
    place by a single #6 machine screw threaded into the switch housing. There have been instances where this screw
    became loose because of stripped threads in the switch housing due to over-tightening. Air Tractor recommends that
    the switch cover be safety wired with MS20995C25 stainless steel safety wire. as directed in Service Letter #321.

    Reducing engine corrosion and erosion can best be reduced by the following:
</p>
<b>Avoidance</b>
<p>
    The best way to protect your engine is to avoid contaminated air. This has the added benefit of also improving the
    life of filters. Below are some steps that should be considered to help to reduce the contaminates ingested by the
    engine.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Point the airplane into the wind during loading so that contaminates blow away from the engine air inlet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use ground idle during ground operation to reduce the amount of dust stirred up by the propeller.
    </li>
    <li>
        When loading multiple airplanes, avoid positioning the airplanes in a way such that one airplane will blow
        contaminants toward the other.
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Maintenance</b>
<p>
    While avoidance is the best way to keep contaminates out, when contaminated air is not completely avoided,
    maintenance practices can help to minimize reduced TBOs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Inspect filters through the inlet as part of the preflight. Check that the filter is properly seated and check
        the face of the filter for excess dirt.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't wait for the air filter light to perform air filter maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clean filters following the cleaning instructions for your specific filter.
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace filters that have reached the end of their life due to hours, age, number of cleanings, or damage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wash the engine per your Pratt and Whitney Maintenance manual. When handling dry fertilizers or corrosive
        chemicals, an engine wash (compressor and CT) is recommended after the last flight each day.
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Inspection</b>
<p>
    Frequently inspect the compressor and turbine discs with a borescope. This allows owners and operators to find corrosion or erosion early while blades can still be repaired. This will help to minimize reduced TBOs.
