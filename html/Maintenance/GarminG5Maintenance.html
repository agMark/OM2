<p>
    Apart from periodically checking the backup battery status, almost all maintenance actions are “on-condition”.
</p>

<div class="boxCautionMedium">
    <p class="boxCautionMediumHeader">CAUTION</p>
    <p class="boxCautionMediumText">
        Mishandling lithium-ion batteries may cause a shorter life span or risk of damage to the instrument, or
        produce a fire, chemical burn, electrolyte leak and/or personal injury.
        Avoid exposing the battery exposed to a high heat source or high temperature environment. The G5 has an
        operating temperature range of -20˚C to +60˚C (-4˚F to +140˚F). The G5 will not allow operation from the battery
        when the battery is outside of this range.
    </p>
</div>

<p><b>Instrument Removal</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Insert a 3/32” hex driver into the access hole located in the bottom center of the display
        unit and loosen the unit from the mounting ring.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disconnect all electrical, pitot-static and other connectors and remove the unit from
        the instrument panel. NOTE: It is not necessary to remove the backup battery unless
        you wish to replace it.
    </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Instrument Installation</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Reconnect the electrical and GPS coaxial connectors (as installed).
    </li>
    <li>
        Reconnect the pitot and static lines to the G5 unit (if installed). The ports are marked
        on the unit using the letters “P” and “S” respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Insert the alignment pin located at the top of the unit into the mating hole in the
        mounting ring and insert a hex drive tool through the access hole in the front cover,
        tightening the unit to the instrument panel using 10-12 inch-pounds of torque.
    </li>
</ol>


<p><b>Battery Capacity Check and Periodic Recharging of the Backup Battery</b></p>

<div class="boxCautionMedium">
    <p class="boxCautionMediumHeader">NOTE</p>
    <p class="boxCautionMediumText">FAILING TO CHECK THE CAPACITY AND RECHARGING THE BATTERY AT LEAST ONCE EVERY 30 DAYS
        WILL LIKELY CAUSE THE BATTERY TO FULLY DISCHARGE, REQUIRING REPLACEMENT.</p>
</div>

<ol>
    <li>
        With NO power applied to the aircraft, turn on the G5 by pressing the power button
        in the lower left corner of the unit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Observe the remaining battery capacity percentage displayed at the top left
        corner of the unit. The remaining capacity will change from percentage to remaining hours
        and minutes after about 60 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the displayed capacity is less than one hour (1:00), allow the battery to charge
        until the capacity shows greater than 95% and repeat the check. The battery is charged
        by applying power to the aircraft.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the remaining capacity is less than one hour (1:00) even after charging, the battery must be replaced.
    </li>
</ol>



<p><b>Troubleshooting</b></p>
<p>
    If a red “X” appears on the display or anywhere in the configuration mode menus, check for loose wire terminals on
    the circuit breaker connections on the power wire(s), popped intermittent circuit breakers and fully seated
    connectors. Also check for a loose wire harness that vibrates during ground and flight operations, G5 mount security
    and that there is no evidence of water or fluid contamination in the area around the unit.
</p>

<p>
    If the G5 will not power up, press and hold the power button in for 10 seconds. If that doesn’t solve the issue,
    remove and reinstall the battery from the G5 unit and then place power on the aircraft. If the G5 still won’t power
    up, it is likely the battery will require replacement.
