<p>The tail gear spring is p/n 40092-6. It is machined of E-4340 aircraft quality steel, formed, heat-treated, and shot-peened for fatigue resistance. It is sand-blasted and primed with an epoxy primer (See Urethane Topcoat Materials) and finished with yellow polyurethane paint. </p>

<p>The forward attachment of the spring to the fuselage frame is with a NAS1308-36 bolt. It is clamped at the rear attachment with a p/n 40140-1 clamp block, which attaches to the fuselage frame with two NAS148-73 bolts. There is a p/n 40146-1 aluminum pad that is installed between the clamp block and the spring to allow the spring to work without putting secondary loads into the fuselage frame or attach bolts. There are .010 thick shims (p/n 3088A322) and sometimes a spacer washer located between the clamp block and the fuselage frame. Per <xref sectionTarget="3.1.9" prependLabel="Section"></xref>, during 12-month inspections the tail gear should be jacked at the stabilizer strut fittings as described under <xref sectionTarget="2.0.4" prependLabel="Section"></xref> and the tail spring checked for looseness at the clamp block. Looseness can be eliminated by removing one or more of the shims from under the clamp block. With the clamp block removed, also check the aluminum pad for condition. </p>

<p>Some early production aircraft used AN bolts in the clamp block for the tail spring. It is also possible that they also did not have a tail spring safety cable installed. If your aircraft does not have NAS bolts in the clamp block or have a safety cable installed, it is recommended that the operator do so according to the information in Service Letter #169.</p>

<p>Besides saving a possible fatigue failure, the forward bolt tends to freeze up if not changed often. Be sure to grease the bolt and snug the nut.  Do not over-tighten as the spring must move on the bolt. Torque the clamp bolts to 900 inch-pounds (torque wrench on bolt head), and make sure there are sufficient shims between the clamp block and the fuselage frame to prevent bending the clamp block as the bolts are torqued. </p>

<p>The tail gear spring will fatigue and break at the same point in the life of the aircraft. The number of hours before failure will vary considerably as some operators make many more landings per flight hour than others, or carry heavier loads, or operate from very rough strips. Pilot technique is a factor also, since some pilots are very rough on airplanes. See <xref sectionTarget="6" prependLabel="Section"></xref> for the fatigue life of the tail gear spring. </p>

<p>Destruction of the old spring with a cutting torch is recommended. </p>
