    Before 2015, the grab handle was secured with AN4 bolts.  After that, the bolts were changed to stronger NAS1304 bolts to 
    decrease the likelihood of bolt failure.  If your grab handle is secured with AN4 bolts, it is recommended that you replace them with NAS1304 bolts.

    Also in 2015, the length of the threaded recess (bore) inside the 11509-1 grab handle was increased from .75 inches to 1.62 inches so that longer bolts could be used.  This was done
    to increase the strength of the connection.  If you replace the grab handle, it is recommended that you use the longer "Rev A" version so that you may
    also use the longer bolts.

    be taken depending on your airplane's configuration at the bolt's next replacement interval:
