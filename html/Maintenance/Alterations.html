<p>Air Tractor recognizes that owners often want or need to modify their airplanes to fit their needs. Many of the modifications are items of equipment offered from the factory or equipment that is offered in the aftermarket. When looking to modify your plane, it should be remembered that modifications to an airplane must have an appropriate airworthiness approval. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration formally calls these modifications "alterations" and places them in two categories: minor alterations and major alterations. In general, major alterations must use approved data. In minor alteration cases acceptable data is typically all that is required.
