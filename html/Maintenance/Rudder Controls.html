    The rudder cables are p/n 70524-5 and attach to stainless link plates (p/n 70094-1) at the rudder horn with AN4C10 bolts, AN310C4 nuts, AN960C416 washers, and MS24665-151 cotters. There are four MS24566-3B pulleys in the rudder cable system to the cockpit.
</p>



<p>In the cockpit, the rudder cables attach to a steel p/n 70096-1 plate which is bolted to a p/n 70313-1 aluminum adjust channel. Also attached to the 70096-1 plate is a p/n 70525-6 cable assembly, which interconnects the rudder with the aileron control system. The interconnect springs under the cockpit floor are p/n 70814-1 and attach to the 70576-1 cable assemblies connected to the upper torque tube. </p>

<p>The rudder pedal hanger assembly (p/n 70109-1) slides in the adjust channel and is held in place with a D5-10T-303 Faspin. The hanger assembly has a spring attached to pull it forward to remove slack from the rudder cable. The spring is attached to an eyebolt in the hanger assembly and is p/n 70102-1. 
</p>

<p>
    The rudder pedal castings are p/n 70115-1 (L/H) and 70115-2 (R/H) and may be removed by taking out the AN3 bolt through the p/n 1SC Caplug on the inboard end of the hanger assembly and removing the AN4-10 bolt attaching the master cylinder strap.
</p>

<p><b>Rudder Pedal Inspection</b></p>
<p>
Remove castings and inspect for cracks around the bronze bushing (p/n 70116-1), bushing wear, and general condition. Grease the hanger assembly and slide the casting back in place. Be sure to use the AN310-4 castle nut with an MS24665-151 cotter on the AN4-10 bolt connecting the master cylinder strap. Also, be sure two AN960-416 washers are installed between the strap and casting, and work the brake several times to be sure clearance exists between the strap and the casting. While the casting is removed, check the condition of the (p/n 70492-1) bronze bushing in the master cylinder strap (p/n 70490-1). Oil the bronze bushings with general purpose oil before re-installing the bolts.
