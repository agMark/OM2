<p>The master cylinders are Cleveland p/n 10-86A. The lower end is bolted to aluminum straps connected to the rudder
    pedal. Both the strap and the pedal have bronze bushings that can be replaced when worn. The bushings are
    oil-impregnated and do not require lubrication. Details of the brake master cylinders are shown below in <xref
        fileTarget="img_Fig_33.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. </p>

<p>The lower end of the master cylinder is attached to a Parker clevis with a Parker check nut. If the rudder pedal
    position (angle) should need changing for pilot comfort, the check nut can be loosened, and the Clevis immediately
    below can be rotated with finger pressure in either direction to increase or decrease the angle that the brake pedal
    makes with the cockpit floor. When desired angle is obtained, torque check nut to 50-60 in-lb. To remove the master
    cylinder, loosen check nut and rotate plunger out of the clevis. Then removing the bolt attaching the master
    cylinder to the steel plates and disconnect the two brake lines at the cylinder. </p>


<p>To prevent the brake master cylinder clevis from disengaging from the master cylinder piston rod, it is recommended
    that the master cylinder piston rod clevis and check nut be inspected to ensure that the rod threads are properly
    engaged in the clevis internal threads and that the check nut is properly torqued. There is a thread engagement
    inspection hole in the side of the clevis. Insert piece of safety wire in the hole to determine if the piston rod is
    screwed into the clevis at least as far as the hole.
</p>

<p>Finally, verify that the clevis and check nut on the master cylinder piston rod have been assembled with Loctite 242
    (Blue). If not yet accomplished, the assembly is to be done according to Drawing 70523 and/or Service Letter #332.
</p>


<p>
    If the check nut at the bottom is left in the
    original position, the pedal angle will be the same as before when the master cylinder is re-installed. Be sure the
    cylinder is free to swing through the full range of rudder pedal travel. If it does not, the two plates which attach
    the cylinder are too close together and require an additional spacer washer.
</p>


<p>If a spot of brake fluid appears on the cockpit floor on the L/H side it does not necessarily mean that the master
    cylinder is leaking. The usual cause is over-filling the brake reservoir, so that when brakes are used, and fluid
    returns to the reservoir, it sometimes leaks through the vent hole in the reservoir cap. </p>

    An overhaul kit is available for the master cylinder.
