<p>The proper maintenance of weight and balance records is important to ensure that the airplane is operated within the weight and center of gravity limits that are established in the Flight Manual. The weight-and-balance diagram with sample calculations is shown below in Figure 2-1. The airplane must be weighed in the attitude described in <xref sectionTarget="2.0.5" prependLabel="Section"></xref>.</p>
