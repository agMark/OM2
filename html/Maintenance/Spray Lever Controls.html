<p>Details of the spray-lever controls are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_62A.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. The p/n 80073-1 for AT-502A/502B (or Transland p/n 21613 for AT-504) spray lever assembly is attached to the aft cockpit wall and has a AG-235 Micro-control attached to limit the lever travel and hence the spray pressure. Keep the threaded screw on the micro-control greased and make sure the tab on the spray lever contacts only the head of the AN4-5A bolt that is attached to the lower adjustment block. </p>
