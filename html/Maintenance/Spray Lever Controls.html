<p>Spray lever controls vary between AT-802 and AT-802A. Each is detailed here. </p>

<p><b>AT-802</b></p>

<p>Details of the spray-lever controls are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_62A.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. The p/n 82240-1 spray lever assembly is attached to the mid-cockpit frame tube and has an AG-235 micro-control attached to limit the lever travel and hence the spray pressure. Keep the threaded screw on the micro-control greased and make sure the tab on the spray lever contacts the bushing that is attached to the lower adjustment block. </p>

<p>The push-rod from the spray lever is p/n 82233-1 and has an adjustable Transland 44356 clevis in the lower end and a Fafnir REP4H6 in the upper end. The pushrod is attached to the bellcrank with an AN3-10A bolt. The clevis end fits a p/n 82237-1 spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued.  </p>

<p>The lower bellcrank is attached to the fuselage with an AN4-25A bolt. The bellcrank has two Fafnir KP6A bearings with a p/n 70081-2 spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued.  </p>

<p><b>For agricultural-only aircraft,</b> the bellcrank is p/n 82230-1 and has a p/n 80132-1 boot, 70140-1 boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with 90013-4 screws and MS21044C08 nuts. 
The push-rod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 81149-1 which has an NMB MS14104-4 bearing in each end. </p>

<p><b>For firefighting aircraft with an optional spray dispersal system,</b> the bellcrank is p/n 82236-1 and has a p/n 80132-1 boot, 70140-1 boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with 90013-4 screws and MS21044C08 nuts. </p>

<p>The push-rod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 80756-1 which has a Fafnir REP4H6 bearing in each end. </p>

<p><b>AT-802A</b></p>

<p>Details of the spray-lever controls are shown in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_62.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. The p/n 80073-9 spray lever assembly is attached to the aft cockpit wall and has an AG-235 micro-control attached to limit the lever travel and hence the spray pressure. Keep the threaded screw on the micro-control greased and make sure the tab on the spray lever contacts only the head of the AN4-5A bolt that is attached to the lower adjustment block. </p>

<p>The push rod from the spray lever is p/n 80580-1 and has an adjustable Fafnir REP4M6 bearing in the lower end and a Fafnir REP4H6 bearing in the upper end. </p>

<p>The lower bellcrank is attached to the fuselage frame with an AN4-25A bolt. The bellcrank has two Fafnir KP6A bearings with a p/n 70081-2 spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued. The bellcrank is p/n 80068-1 and has a p/n 80132-1 boot, 70140-1 boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with 90013-4 screws, MS21044C08 nuts. </p>

<p><b>For agricultural-only aircraft,</b> the pushrod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 80065-8 which has a NMB MS14104-4 bearing in each end. </p>

<p><b>For firefighting aircraft with an optional spray dispersal system,</b> the pushrod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 80756-1 which has a Fafnir REP4H6 bearing in each end. </p>

<p>The spray lever in the cockpit can be adjusted to personal preference by adjusting the Spray Handle Adjustment Bearing as shown in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_62.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> . The procedures that may be followed for adjustment of the spray-lever position in the cockpit: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Remove the bolt that secures the adjustment bearing to the bellcrank.</li>
    <li>Loosen the check nut on the stem of the clevis.</li>
    <li>Secure the bellcrank to hold the spray valve in the SPRAY OFF position.</li>
    <li>Secure the cockpit spray handle in the desired position for SPRAY OFF.</li>
    <li>Adjust the clevis to align with the bolt holes in the bellcrank.</li>
    <li>Replace the bolt, washer (s), and nut and retighten the check nut.</li>
    <li>Check travel of spray handle in cockpit. If necessary, repeat steps 1 through 6 for best fit. </li>
