Many experienced Air Tractor operators maintain a strict schedule for routine cleaning of their aircraft. For airplanes operated in corrosive environments it is a best practice to clean them daily. This is a reminder of the importance of proper cleaning. This has been noted in prior Service Letters 283, 299 & 385. The following steps are recommended to greatly reduce the possibility of corrosion. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the aircraft regularly when it has been exposed to saltwater or corrosive chemicals. Use fresh water (we do not recommend using well water). Use caution if choosing to use a pressure washer as to not damage painted or coated surfaces or other delicate equipment. Use a brush for reaching small crevices on the airframe. Fuselage side skins are to be removed and contaminates flushed out. Dry with clean towels. </li>
<li> Do not use strong soaps, detergents, or cleaning agents containing acid, caustic, or abrasives. Use commercially available car wash (non-detergent) products that will not remove protective wax. </li>
<li>All cleaning agents should be rinsed promptly and not allowed to dry on the paint surface. Many fertilizers absorb water, so it is important to remove debris from the airplane and let it dry, whenever possible. </li>
<li>Waxing your aircraft occasionally is recommended to remove residue and further protect the paint finish. Do not use waxes containing abrasive compounds. </li>
<li> Always inspect paint surface during washing or waxing for scratches or chips. Repaint or touchup any area where the paint is damaged. </li>
<li>Protective coatings such as Par-Al-Ketone (Black Bear) or Corrosion X can be used to help extend the service life of internal working components such as rod end bearings, and pulleys. </li>
</ul>
<p>The best tools to fight corrosion are fresh water, acid-free soap, a brush for small joints on the airframe, dry towels, and applications of wax. Coupled with protective coatings and a strict cleaning schedule, these simple practices will help keep the airplane exterior in good condition and help avoid unnecessary maintenance.</p>
