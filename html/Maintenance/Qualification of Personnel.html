    Maintenance to your plane is to be accomplished by or under the direct supervision of an authorized and <u><b>qualified</b></u> person or entity
    and is to be <u><b>properly</b></u> returned to service before the plane is operated. Inspections are to be accomplished by an
    appropriately rated and <b><u>qualified</u></b> person or entity and must determine that the plane is in airworthy condition. 
    <p>
    <b><u>To be in airworthy
    condition, the plane must meet the type design (i.e. the approved factory design) or be altered in accordance
    with approved data; and be in a condition for safe operation.</u></b>
