<p>
    The rudder trim system is to be rigged such that when the rudder is centered, and the cockpit control is centered 
    in the takeoff position, the trim tab is deflected 5/16" to the left of the rudder when measured at 
    the top of the tab.
</p>
<p>
    Verify adequate thread engagement for all pushrods and hardware.  If required, it is permissible to substitute the 70954-6 pushrod 
    for the standard 70954-1 pushrod to achieve the proper rigging (The -6 pushrod is 7/8" longer).

<p class="dontBreakAfter"><b>When Wipaire STC SA019CH is Installed</b></p>
<p>
    The Wipaire STC requires that the rudder trim rigging be slightly adjusted to account for the change in maximum torque.
    Verify what version of this STC is installed and follow any directions provided with the STC.  
</p>
<p>
    The following directions are provided
    for reference and if there is any discrepancy, the STC documentation should be followed.
</p>
<p>
    Rig the rudder trim tab to be 2° for nose right (trailing edge to the left) with travel from 5° nose right to 1° nose left ±1.
