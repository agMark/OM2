    for the location of the fuel tank and header tank drains. These drains are designated for 
    daily activation during the pilot's walk-around inspection as shown in the AIRPLANE FLIGHT MANUAL.
</p>
<p>
    The header tank drain has a tendency to freeze up during fertilization operations if it is not activated daily. 
    If this should happen, replace it immediately as this is the most important drain in the system. 
    Be careful not to cross-thread drains when replacing. 
</p>

<p>
    The wing tanks have Curtis CCA-1650 drain valves and the header tank and the header tank has 
    a Curtis 39000 drain valve. If the valves leak, remove them and check the seals for nicks and 
    look for trash between the seal and the valve seat. Apply some 3H Permatex or equivalent to the 
    threads of all drains before they are re-installed. If the seal is bad, replace the valve.

<p><b>Valves with Enhanced Corrosion Protection</b></p>
<p>
    In 2025, Air Tractor received a report of a broken fuel shut off valve drain which allowed air to be
    introduced into the fuel system (Ref SL 413).  Subsequently, valves were certified to provide enhanced corrosion protection.
    Air Tractor suggests that you replace brass valves with stainless steel valves if you airplanes are exposed to 
    unusually corrosive environments and materials.  See <xref fileTarget="img_FuelShutoffDrainValve.png"></xref>
    and <xref fileTarget="img_WingDainValve.png"></xref>.

<p><b>Operating Precautions</b></p>
<p>
    Air Tractor received a report that the retaining ring at the end of the drain stem was cracked. 
    If the retaining ring had cracked on the other side as well, the stem would have fallen out of the 
    valve body, and all of the fuel would have been lost.
</p>

<p>
    The cracked retaining ring was probably a result of allowing the stem to snap shut, with the force of 
    the spring hammering shut the O-ring on the seat. It is suggested to ease the valve closed, rather than 
    allowing it to snap shut. Any valve found with a cracked retainer ring must be replaced.
