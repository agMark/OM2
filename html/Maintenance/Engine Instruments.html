    Originally, the NP Indicator, NG Indicator and the ITT Indicator were independent of the airplane's electrical system. They were
    powered by their respective tach-generators or thermocouple (except for lighting).  The wiring schematics for these instruments
    are shown in <xref fileTarget="img_IttIndicatorSchematic_OldStyle.png"></xref> and <xref fileTarget="img_NpNgIndicatorSchematic_OldStyle.png"></xref>.

    Subsequently, Ahlers instruments were incorporated which use airplane electrical power for operation.

    The Fuel Filter Pressure Light, Low Oil Pressure Light, Oil Temperature Indicator, Air Filter Pressure Light, Chip
    Light, and Hour Meter are all powered by the airplane's electrical system.

<b>Differential Torquemeters</b>
<p>
    Beginning in the second half of 2014, Air Tractor began installation of a differential pressure torquemeter. The
    previous torquemeters ran off of a single oil pressure line from the torque pressure port “AD” on the engine
    propeller reduction gearbox (RGB). This port provided pressure from the torque piston within the RGB. The single
    port torquemeter displayed the engine torque corresponding to the difference between the torque piston pressure and
    atmospheric pressure.
</p>

<p>
    The differential pressure/dual port torquemeters reference an additional oil pressure line from the RGB, port “AC”
    instead of atmospheric pressure. This pressure is the internal pressure of the gearbox. The torquemeter indicates
    the difference in pressures from the high pressure port “AD” and the low pressure port “AC” for increased indication
    accuracy. Refer to Service Letter #328 for additional information.
</p>


<b>Oil Migration in Torque Indicators</b>
<p>
    There have been a few reports of the face of the torque indicator filling with engine oil on turbine powered aircraft
    incorporating a “dual wet line” torque indicating system.
</p>

<p>
    It is likely that engine oil from the engine reduction gear box is migrating through the low pressure torque line and
    filling the torque indicator housing. The torque indicator continues to function properly. If this occurs, the
    torque indicating system may be retrofitted back to the original “single wet line” configuration following the
    directions in Service Letter #350.
