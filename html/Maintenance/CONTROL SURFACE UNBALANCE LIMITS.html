<p>Flutter occurs when vibrations in an aircraft match the natural frequency of the structure.  If not properly damped, the amplitude of oscillations can increase to a point that it leads to structural damage or failure.  In order to avoid flutter in control surfaces, the following check for control surface unbalance has been developed. </p>

<p>When measuring unbalance, the control surfaces are painted complete with any applicable nav lights and tabs installed. </p>

<p>To measure the unbalance, the control surface is mounted horizontally on the hinge line as shown in the following figure.  The trailing edge is supported with a scale and distance “x" measured.  The unbalance is equal to “x" multiplied by the scale reading “w".  This value must not exceed the maximum allowable unbalance limit as specified below. </p>

<p>Unbalance limits for the <p style='color:red;'>XXXX</p>: </p>
<div class="tabOver">
    <p>Ailerons </p>
    <p class="tabOver">XXXX inch-lbs </p>
    <p>Elevators</p>
    <p class="tabOver">XXXX inch-lbs</p>
    <p>Rudder</p>
    <p class="tabOver">XXXX inch-lbs</p>
</div>

<p>If the unbalance exceeds the limits above, you will likely need to strip and re-paint (especially if the surface has been painted multiple times) or check the counterweights.
