    It is possible to install ballast onto the engine mount to shift the center of gravity forward.
    Installation of ballast is to be performed in accordance with Air Tractor Drawing 52199.  Contact
    Air Tractor Customer Service for ballast weights, installation kit and instructions.

    For planning purposes, the weight of the ballast weights are shown in the following table:

<table class="plainTableMedium">
    <tr>
        <th class="plainTableHeaderCell">Location</th>
        <th class="plainTableHeaderCell">Part Number</th>

    </tr>   
</table>

<p>
    All weights can be assumed to be located at FS -70.0.  Individual weights may be installed or removed
    as needed to achieve the desired weight and balance.  Total weight must not exceed 300 lb including 
    lead that may be installed in the engine ring.  50821-70 and 50821-78 engine mounts installed 
    on AT-802's (2-seaters) have lead in the engine ring.  50821-77 and 50821-79 engine mounts installed
    on AT-802A's do not have lead in the engine ring.  Contact Air Tractor Customer Service if you are unsure.
</p>

<p>
    After installing ballast weights, it is recommended that you re-weigh the aircraft to verify weight and balance.
