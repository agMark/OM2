<p>The wiring schematic for the windshield washer is shown in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_38.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below. When the switch is closed, the pump's motor starts and the solenoid valve is opened. The flow of windshield-washing fluid will continue until the switch it released. The purpose of the solenoid is to provide a sharp cut-off of fluid when the switch is released. This prevents fluid from dribbling onto the windshield. </p>
