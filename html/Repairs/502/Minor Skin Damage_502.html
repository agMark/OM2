<p style='color:black;'>There is a difference in the structural requirement of fuselage skins as opposed to wing and tail surface skins. The skins of the fuselage are not primary structure and the tolerance for damage in fuselage skins is greater than that of stressed skin design of wing and tail surface skins.

Acceptable Limits of Damage for Skins

Wing, flap, aileron, horizontal stabilizer, elevator, fin and rudder skins are acceptable for continued service with small dents and or light scratches. Small dents are those that do not exceed ¼" deep and 2" in diameter, are smooth (without sharp edges or deep scratches). Scratches should be no deeper than 1/4 of the skin material thickness. Any cracks in these skins should be repaired with the guidance of AC-43.13 or the skin replaced.

Since the primary structure of the fuselage is the 4130 steel fuselage frame tubing the skins are not as critical. Dents as deep as ½" and as large as 4" in diameter are allowable. Scratches as deep as 1/2 the thickness of the skin material is also allowable. Cracks in fuselage skins that do not exceed 1" in length are also allowable.

Any known damage as described above shall be monitored by visual inspections to ensure that they do not grow past the allowable limits, and as a matter of good practice we recommend that any damaged skins be repaired or replaced during the off season. They may be repaired as described below.

Repairing Negligible Damage

On repairs of negligible damage Air Tractor has used the Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook Airframe, Volume 1, from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, for guidance. Under these guidelines negligible damage consists of visually apparent surface damage that does not affect the structural integrity of the component involved.

Negligible damage may be left as is or may be corrected by a simple procedure without restricting flight. In both cases, some corrective action must be taken to keep the damage from spreading. Negligible or minor damage areas must be inspected frequently to ensure the damage does not spread. Permissible limits for negligible damage vary for different components of different aircraft and should be carefully researched on an individual basis. Failure to ensure that damages within the specified limit of negligible damage may result in insufficient structural strength of the affected support member for critical flight conditions.

Small dents, scratches, cracks, and holes that can be repaired by smoothing, sanding, stop drilling, or hammering out, or otherwise repaired without the use of additional materials, fall in this classification.
