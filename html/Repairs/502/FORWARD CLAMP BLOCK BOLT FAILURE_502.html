<p style='color:black;'>If the wheel strike has caused the forward clamp block bolt to break, it is likely that the gear leg has folded back under the aircraft and broken the large inboard attach bolt and the aft clamp bolt. When the large inboard bolt fails, it usually damages the 1-1/2” OD bushing that it was attached to, and as the gear folds back the sharp edge of the gear leg damages the 3.0” diameter tube that the bushing is welded to.

The broken bolts can be removed from the attach fitting by the conventional practice of drilling into the broken off bolt shank and using an Easy-Out tool to remove the bolt shank. Be careful not to damage the threads, but if there appears to be slight thread damage, use a 7/8-14 bottoming tap with a generous amount of cutting oil to re-work the threads, making sure that the tap is started exactly with the original threads.

The damage to the 1 1/2” OD bushing is usually confined to the rear lower side, where the 1-1/8” bolt has bent before failing. Consult the factory for authorized repairs to this area.
