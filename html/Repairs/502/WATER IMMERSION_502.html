<p style='color:black;'>When an airplane has been partially or fully immersed in salt or fresh water, hidden damage may be quite significant. To address what must be done to return the engine to service, consult the engine manufacturers maintenance manual. With respect to the airframe, the airplane may require extensive disassembly to address the damage from trapped water and other contaminants.

Air Tractor will track in its database any airplane that has been totaled due to water immersion. Be aware that Air Tractor will not support the repair/rebuild of these airplanes by supplying new parts.

Our primary concern is the long-term structural health of any affected aircraft or aircraft components, and the safety of those affected by the operation of an airplane or components that have been immersed in water.
